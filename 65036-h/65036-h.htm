<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
  Unwelcome Guests at the Three Oaks Inn
  </h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LL day the strident whistle of the
locust had declared for a continuation
of the parching heat. The
meadows lay brown under the glare of the
August sun; the roads were deep in
powdery yellow dust. The cattle stood
with sweating flanks in the shade of the
oaks which bordered the stage track, and
although the sun was now declining toward
the summits of the distant mountains,
all nature continued in the somnolence of
a summer day.</p>

<p>A huddle of sheep under a wagon shed
and the lolling form of a big collie dog in
the barnyard were the only signs of life
about the Three Oaks Inn. Mistress and
maids, as well as the guests now sheltered
by its moss-grown roof, had retired to the
cooler chambers, and Jonas Benson, the
portly landlord, snored loudly in his armchair
in the hall. Out of this hall, with its
exposed beams of time-blackened oak and
its high fanlight over the entrance, opened
the main room, its floor sanded in an intricate
pattern that very morning by one of the
maids. Across the hall was the closed door
of the darkened parlor.</p>

<p>Had Jonas Benson been of a more wakeful
mind this hot afternoon, it is quite likely
that this narrative would never have been
written. But he snored on while behind
the closed door of the parlor were whispered
words which, had they reached the ears of
the landlord of the Three Oaks, would have
put him instantly on the alert.</p>

<p>The year was 1777, a fateful one indeed
for the American arms in the struggle for
liberty&mdash;a year of both blessing and misfortune
for the patriot cause. Within its
twelve months the Continental army
achieved some notable victories; but it suffered,
too, memorable defeats. It was the
year when human liberty seemed trembling
in the balance, when all nations&mdash;even
France&mdash;stood aloof, waiting to see whether
the star of the American Colonies was setting
or on the ascendant. The British
army, under Howe and Clinton, occupied
New York. Washington and his little
force lay near Philadelphia, then the capital
of the newly-formed confederation. New
Jersey&mdash;all the traveled ways between the
two armies&mdash;was disputed territory, disturbed
continually by a sort of guerilla warfare
most hard for the peacefully-inclined
farmers and tradespeople to bear.</p>

<p>Spies of both sides in the great conflict
infested the country: foraging parties, like
the rain, descended upon the just and the
unjust; and neighbors who had lived in
harmony for years before the war broke out,
now were at daggers’ points. The Tories
had grown confident because of the many
set-backs endured by the patriot forces.
Many even prophesied that, when Burgoyne’s
army, then being gathered beyond
the Canadian border, should descend the
valleys of upper New York and finally join
Howe and Clinton, the handful of Americans
bearing arms against the king would
be fairly swept into the sea, or ground to
powder between the victorious British
lines.</p>

<p>Jonas Benson was intensely patriotic, and
the Three Oaks had given shelter oft and
again to scouts and foraging parties of the
Continental troops. The inn-keeper had
given the pick of his horses to the army,
reserving few but such nags as were positively
needed for the coach which went
down to Trenton at irregular intervals.
There were more than his staid coach
horses in the stable on this afternoon, however,
and the fact was much to his distaste.</p>

<p>There had arrived at the Three Oaks the
evening before a private carriage drawn by
a pair of handsome bays and driven by a
most solemn-faced Jehu, whose accent was
redolent of Bow Bells. With the carriage
came a gentleman&mdash;a fierce, military-looking
man, though not in uniform&mdash;who rode
a charger, which, so Jonas told his wife,
would have made a saint envious, providing
the latter were a judge of horseflesh. Inside
the carriage rode a very pretty girl of
sixteen or seventeen, whose dress and appearance
were much different from the plain
country lasses of that region.</p>

<p>“They’re surely gentle folk, Jonas,” Mistress
Benson had declared. “The sweet
child is a little lady&mdash;see how proud she
holds herself. Law! it’s been a long day
since we served real gentles here.”</p>

<p>Jonas snorted disdainfully; he suspected
that at heart his good wife had royalist
tendencies. As for him, the American
officers who sometimes made the Three
Oaks their headquarters for a few days were
fine enough folk. “I tell ye what, woman,”
he said, “they may be great folk or not;
one thing I do know. They possess great
influence or they’d never gotten through
the Britishers with them fine nags. And if
the outposts weren’t so far away, I’m
blessed if I believe they’d get away from
here without our own lads having a shy
at the horses.”</p>

<p>But the Bensons were too busy making
their guests comfortable to discuss them&mdash;or
their horses&mdash;to any length. Colonel
Creston Knowles was the name the gentleman
gave, and the girl was his daughter,
Miss Lillian. The driver of the carriage,
who served the colonel as valet as well, was
called William, and a more stony-faced, unemotional
individual it had never been the
fate of the Bensons to observe. It was
utterly impossible to draw from this servant
a word regarding his master’s business between
the lines of the opposing armies.</p>

<p>These visitors were not desired by Jonas.
He kept a public house, and, for the sake of
being at peace with everybody, his Tory
neighbors included, he treated all guests
who came to the Three Oaks with unfailing
cordiality. But the presence of Colonel
Knowles at this time was bound to cause
trouble.</p>

<p>The inn was on the road usually traversed
by those in haste to reach Philadelphia,
where, while Washington’s army was
posted nearby, Congress held its session.
Many a time in the dead of night there was
the rattle of hoofs on the road, as a breathless
rider dashed up to the door, and with
a loud “Halloa” aroused the stable boy.
Then in a few moments, mounted afresh, he
would hurry on into the darkness. These
dispatch-bearers of the American army
knew they could trust mine host of the
Three Oaks, and that a ridable nag could
always be found somewhere in his stable.</p>

<p>The very night Colonel Knowles arrived
at the tavern there was an occurrence of this
kind. And after the dispatch-bearer had
gone, and Jonas and Hadley Morris, the
stable boy, stood in the paved yard watching
him disappear on the moonlit road, they
saw a night-capped head at the colonel’s
window.</p>

<p>“We’ll have no peace, Had, while yon
Britisher’s hereabout,” muttered the old
man.</p>

<p>“I wonder why he has come into this
country, so far from New York?” was the
boy’s observation. “He
can’t be upon military
service, though he be a
colonel in his majesty’s
army.”</p>

<p>“He’s here for no
good, mark that, Had,”
grumbled Jonas. “I’d
rather have no guests at
the Three Oaks than
men of his kidney.”</p>

<p>“His daughter is a
pretty girl, and kindly
spoken.”</p>

<p>“That may be&mdash;that
may be,” testily.
“You’re as shortsighted
as my old wife, Had.
You’ll both let this Master
Creston Knowles throw
dust in your eyes because
he’s got a pretty daughter.
Bah!”</p>

<p>And Jonas stumbled
back to bed, leaving
Hadley Morris to retire
to his couch on the loft
floor of the stable.</p>

<p>But had these well-founded
suspicions been
to any purpose, the inn-keeper
surely would have
remained awake on the
afternoon our story
opens, instead of lolling,
sound asleep, in his wide
chair in the hall. Behind
the parlor door, not ten
feet away from mine
host of the Three Oaks,
Colonel Creston Knowles was conversing
in a low tone with his serving man.</p>

<p>“And you say it happened twice during
the night, sirrah?” queried the British officer,
who spoke to everybody but his
daughter with sternness.</p>

<p>“Twice, hand it please ye, sir. Hi’m sure
the stable was hopened once hafter the time
you was hup, sir, hand another ’orse taken
hout. My life! but Hi thought hit thieves
hat first, sir&mdash;some o’ them murderin’ cowboys;
but the young lad has tends to the
’orses seemed to know them that came,
hand they did not touch hour hanimals,
sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s a regular nest of rebels!” exclaimed
the colonel, his brow black enough at the
report. “Such places as this should be
razed to the earth. The spies who report
to this Mr. Washington and his brother
rebels evidently have free course through
the country. They even exchange their
steeds here&mdash;and Malcolm’s troop lying
less than six miles away this very day.
William!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>The colonel beckoned him nearer and
whispered an inaudible order in the man’s
ear. There was no change of expression
upon the servant’s countenance, and the
command might have been welcome or distasteful
as far as an observer could have
told. When the colonel ceased speaking,
William rose without a word and tiptoed
cautiously to the door. On pulling this
ajar, however, the lusty snoring of Jonas
Benson warned him of the inn-keeper’s
presence. He closed the door again,
nodded to the colonel, and vaulted through
one of the open windows, thus making his
exit without disturbing the landlord.</p>

<p>But although everybody about the tavern
itself seemed to be slumbering, the colonel’s
man found that he could not enter the stable
without being observed. As he came out
of the glare of sunshine into the half darkness
of the wide threshing floor, the Englishman
suddenly came upon a figure standing
between him and the narrow window
at the further end of the stable. It was the
stable boy and he was just buckling the
saddle-girth upon a nervous little black
mare whose bit was fastened to a long
halter hanging from one of the cross-beams.</p>

<p>Hadley Morris was a brawny youth for
his age, which was seventeen. He was by
no means handsome, and few boys would
be attractive-looking in the clothing of a
stable boy. Yet there was that in his carriage,
in the keenness of his eye, in the
firm lines of his chin and lip, which would
have attracted a second glance from any
thoughtful observer. Hadley had been
now more than a year at the Three Oaks
Inn, ever since it had become too unpleasant
for him to longer remain with his
uncle, Ephraim Morris, a Tory farmer of
the neighborhood. Hadley was legally
bound to Ephraim, better known, perhaps,
as “Miser Morris,” and, of course, was not
permitted to join the patriot army as he
had wished. The youth might have broken
away from his uncle altogether had he
so desired, but there were good reasons
why he had not yet taken this decisive
step.</p>

<p>He had found it impossible to live longer
under his uncle’s roof, however, and therefore
had gone to work for Jonas Benson;
but he still considered himself bound to his
uncle, and Jonas grumblingly paid over to
the farmer the monthly wage which the boy
faithfully earned. Hadley found occasion
oft and again to further the cause which in
his soul he espoused. It was he rather than
the landlord who saw to it that the fleetest
horse in the stable was ready saddled
against the expected arrival of one of those
dispatch-bearers whose coming and going
had disturbed Colonel Knowles the night
before. As he now tightened the girth of
the mare’s trappings she danced about as
though eager to be footing it along the
stage road toward the river.</p>

<p>Hadley was startled by the sudden appearance
of the colonel’s servant in the
doorway of the barn.</p>

<p>“So you are riding hout, too?” observed
the latter, going toward the stalls occupied
by his master’s thoroughbreds. “There’s a
deal of going back and forth ’ere, hit seems
to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing so lively as it was before
the war broke out,” Hadley explained,
good-naturedly. “Then the coaches went
out thrice a week to Trenton, and one of the
New York and Philadelphia stages always
stopped here, going and coming. Business
is killed and the country is all but dead
now.”</p>

<p>William grunted as he backed out one
of the carriage horses and threw his
master’s saddle upon it. “You’re going
out yourself, I see.” Hadley said, observing
that the man did not saddle the colonel’s
charger.</p>

<p>“Hi’ve got to give the beasts some hexercise
if we’re goin’ ter lie ’ere day hafter
day,” grumbled William, and swung himself
quickly into the saddle.</p>

<p>The boy went to the open door and
watched him ride heavily away from the
inn, with a puzzled frown upon his brow.
“He’s never going for exercise such a hot
afternoon as this,” muttered the youth.
“There! he’s put the horse on the gallop.
He’s going somewhere a-purpose&mdash;and he’s
in haste. Will he take the turn to the
Mills, I wonder, or keep straight on for
Trenton?”</p>

<p>The trees which shaded the road hid
horse and rider, and leaving the little mare
dancing on the barn floor, Hadley ran
hastily up the ladder to the loft, and then
by a second ladder reached the little cupola,
or ventilator, which Master Benson had
built atop his barn. From this point of
vantage all the roads converging near the
Three Oaks Inn could be traced for several
miles.</p>

<p>Behind the cluster of tall trees which gave
the inn its name, a road branched off toward
the Mills. In a minute or less the watcher
saw a horseman dash along this road amid
a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“He’s bound for the Mills&mdash;and in a
wonderful hurry. What was it Lafe Holdness
told us when he was along here the
other day? Something about a troop of
British horse being at the Mills, I’ll be
bound.” Then he turned toward the east
and looked carefully along the brown road
on which any person coming from the way
of New York would naturally travel. “Well,
there’s nobody in sight yet. If that fellow
means mischief&mdash;Ah! but it’s six miles
to the Mills and if he continues to ride like
that on this hot day the horse will be
winded long before he gets there.”</p>

<p>He went down the ladders, however, with
anxious face, and during the ensuing hour
made many trips to the wide gateway which
opened upon the dusty road. There was not
a sign of life, however, in either direction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tavern awakened to its
ordinary life and bustle. The last rays of
the sun slanted over the mountain tops and
the shadows crept farther and farther across
the meadows. The old collie arose and
stretched himself lazily, while the tinkle of
sheep bells and the heavier jangle which betrayed
the approach of the cattle cut the
warm air sharply. Even a breeze arose
and curled the road dust in little spirals
and rustled the oak leaves. Dusk was approaching
to relieve panting nature.</p>

<p>Jonas awoke with a start and came out
upon the tavern porch to stretch himself.
He saw Hadley standing by the gateway
and asked:</p>

<p>“Got the mare saddled, Had?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. She’s been standing on the
barn floor for an hour. One of the other
horses has gone out, sir.”</p>

<p>“Heh? How’s that?” He tiptoed softly
to the end of the porch so as to be close
above the boy. “Who’s been here?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Nobody. But the colonel’s man took
one of those bays and started for the Mills
an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“I d’know as I like the sound of that,”
muttered Jonas. “I wish these folks warn’t
here&mdash;that I do. They aint meanin’ no
good&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Hadley, warningly.</p>

<p>From the wide tavern door there suddenly
appeared the British colonel’s
daughter. She was indeed a pretty girl and
her smile was infectious. Even Jonas’ face
cleared at sight of her and he hastened, as
well as a man of his portliness could, to set
a chair for her.</p>

<p>“It is very beautiful here,” Miss Lillian
said, “and so peaceful. I got so tired in
New York seeing soldiers everywhere and
hearing about war. It doesn’t seem as
though anything ever happened here.”</p>

<p>“I b’lieve something’s goin’ to happen
b’fore long, though,” the landlord whispered
anxiously to Hadley, and walked to
the other end of the porch, leaving the two
young people together.</p>

<p>“It is usually very quiet about here,”
Hadley said, trying to speak easily to the
guest. He was not at all used to girls, and
Miss Lillian was altogether out of his class.
He felt himself rough and uncouth in her
presence. “But we see soldiers once in a
while.”</p>

<p>“Our soldiers?” asked the girl, smiling.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not British soldiers,” Hadley replied,
slowly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you surely don’t call those ragamuffin
colonists soldiers, do you?” she
asked, quickly.</p>

<p>A crimson flush spread from Hadley’s
bronzed neck to his brow; but a little smile
followed and his eyes twinkled. “I don’t
know what you’d really call them; but they
made your grenadiers fall back at Bunker
Hill.”</p>

<p>Miss Lillian bit her lip in anger; then, as
she looked down into the stable boy’s face
her own countenance cleared and she
laughed aloud. “I don’t think I’ll quarrel
with you,” she said. “You are a rebel, I
suppose, and I am an English girl. You
don’t know what it means to be born across
the water, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes I do. I was born in England
myself,” Hadley returned. “My mother
brought me across when she came to keep
house for Uncle Ephraim Morris&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who?” interposed Lillian, turning towards
him again, with astonishment in both
voice and countenance.</p>

<p>“My mother.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I mean the man&mdash;your uncle.
What is his name?”</p>

<p>“Ephraim Morris. He is a farmer back
yonder,” and Hadley pointed over his
shoulder. “My name is Hadley Morris.”</p>

<p>Before Lillian could comment upon this,
or explain her sudden interest in his uncle’s
name, both were startled by an exclamation
from the landlord at the other end of the
porch.</p>

<p>“Had! Had!” he called. “He’s coming.”</p>

<p>Hadley left the gate at once and leaped
into the road. Far down the dusty highway
there appeared a little balloon of dust, and
the faint ring of rapid hoofs reached their
ears. Somebody was riding furiously toward
the inn from the east. Lillian rose to
look, too, and in the doorway appeared the
military figure of her father. His face
looked very grim indeed as he gazed, as
the others were doing, down the road.</p>

<p>The advancing horseman was less than a
quarter of a mile away when, of a sudden,
there sounded a single pistol shot&mdash;then
another and another. It was a scattering
volley, but at the first report those watching
at the inn could see the approaching horse
fairly leap ahead under the spur of its
rider.</p>

<p>“Ha! the scoundrels are after him!”
cried the inn-keeper, his fat face paling.</p>

<p>The colonel’s countenance expressed
sudden satisfaction. “Go into the house,
Lillian!” he commanded. “There will be
trouble here in a moment.” He brought
out from under his coat tails as he spoke a
huge pistol such as was usually carried in
saddle holsters at that day.</p>

<p>Hadley Morris, from the centre of the
road, did not see the colonel’s weapon. He
only observed the approaching horseman in
the cloud of dust, and knew him to be a
dispatch-bearer aiming to reach the ferry
and Washington’s headquarters beyond.
In a moment there loomed up behind him
a group of pursuers riding neck and neck
upon his trail. They were British dragoons
and the space between them and their prey
was scarce a hundred yards.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
RELATING A WILD NIGHT RIDE</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T did not take a very sharp eye to observe
that the horse which the messenger
bestrode was laboring sorely,
while his pursuers were blessed with comparatively
fresh mounts. The American
had ridden long and hard, and his steed was
in no shape for such a spurt of speed as it
was put to now. The British had kept
clear of this road for weeks, because of the
foraging parties from Philadelphia, and,
doubtless, the dispatch-bearer hoped to find
at the Three Oaks those who would stand
him well in this emergency.</p>

<p>At least, there would be a fresh horse
there, and perhaps a faithful man or two
to help beat off the dragoons until he could
escape with his precious charge. He had
no thought that there was a still greater
danger ahead of him. The dragoons were
lashing and spurring their horses to the
utmost; and now and again one took a potshot
at him; but there on the porch of the
old inn stood Colonel Knowles, waiting
with all the calmness of a sportsman to
bring the fleeing man to earth.</p>

<p>Young Hadley Morris did not notice the
colonel; he had forgotten his presence in
his interest in the flight and pursuit. But
Jonas Benson saw his guest’s big pistol
and realized the danger to the approaching
fugitive. Yet there seemed nothing he
could do to avert the calamity. He dared
not openly attack the colonel, for whether
the dispatch-bearer escaped or no, the
dragoons would be at the inn in a few
moments, and, there being no such force of
Americans in the neighborhood, they might
wreak vengeance on him and his family.
The old man was hard put to it, indeed, in
this emergency.</p>

<p>Not so Hadley, however. He was quick
of thought and quite as brisk of action.
The charge of galloping horse was but a
short distance away, the American still a
little in the lead, when the boy darted back
to the heavy barred gate which shut the
yard from the road. The barrier had
been swung wide open and fastened with
a loop of rope to a hook in the side of
the house. He slipped this fastening and
stood ready to shut the gate between the
fugitive and his pursuers, and thus delay
the latter for a possible few moments.</p>

<p>If the dispatch-bearer got into the yard
safely he could leap upon the back of the
black mare now standing impatiently on
the barn floor, and escape his pursuers
through the fields and orchard back of
the outbuildings. No ordinary horse
would be able to leap the high gate, and
Hadley did not believe the dragoons were
overly well mounted. As the dispatch-bearer
dashed up, foam flying from his
horse’s mouth and the blood dripping from
its flanks where the cruel spurs had done
their work, it looked to Colonel Knowles
as though the American would ride right
by, and he raised his pistol in a deliberate
intention of bringing the man to earth.</p>

<p>But as he pulled the trigger old Jonas
stumbled against him and the ball went
wide of its mark. The shot did much
harm, however, for it frightened the already
maddened horse, which leaped to one
side, pitching the man completely over its
head upon the paving of the yard. The
horse fell, too, but outside the gate, and
Hadley was able to slam the barrier and
drop the bar into place before the dragoons
arrived.</p>

<p>The explosion of the colonel’s pistol and
that officer’s angry shout warned Hadley
of the added and closer danger. He darted
to the side of the fallen messenger. The
poor fellow had struggled partly up and
was tearing at his coat. His face was
covered with blood, for he was badly injured
by his fall; but one thought kept him
conscious.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>HE DARTED TOWARD THE FALLEN MESSENGER</p></div>
</div>

<p>“The papers&mdash;the papers, lad!” he
gasped. “For General Washington&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>But he had only half pulled the packet
from his inner pocket when he dropped
back upon the flagstones, and, with a groan,
lay still.</p>

<p>Hadley seized the precious packet and
leaped to his feet. With a clatter of hoofs
and amid a cloud of dust the dragoons
arrived at the yard gate.</p>

<p>“There he is! He’s down&mdash;down!”
shouted the leader. “We’ve got him safe!
Hi, there landlord! open your gate or
we’ll batter it in!”</p>

<p>“They’ve got him safe, that’s a fact,”
muttered Hadley, in distress. “But&mdash;but
they haven’t got the papers!”</p>

<p>He turned swiftly and ran toward the
barn.</p>

<p>“There goes one of them running!”
shouted a voice behind. Then a pistol exploded
and Hadley leaped forward as
though the ball had stung him, although it
whistled far above his head.</p>

<p>“Look out for that boy!” he heard Colonel
Knowles say, and, glancing back,
Hadley saw the officer leaning out of
one of the windows which overlooked the
yard. At a neighboring casement the
fleeing youth saw Miss Lillian. Even at
that distance, and in so perilous a moment,
Hadley noted that the girl’s face was very
pale and that she watched him with clasped
hands and anxious countenance.</p>

<p>One of the dragoons had dismounted and
now unbarred the gate. Before Hadley
reached the wide doorway of the great barn
the soldiers were trooping through into the
yard.</p>

<p>“The boy has the papers&mdash;look after him,
I tell you!” he heard the colonel shout.
Then Hadley pulled the great door shut and
fastened it securely on the inside. For an
instant he could breathe.</p>

<p>But only for an instant. The dragoons
were at the door then, beating upon it with
the hilts of their sabres and pistol-butts,
demanding entrance. Hadley had no
weapon had he desired to defend the
barn from attack. And that would be a
foolish attempt, indeed. It would be an
easy matter for the dragoons to break down
the fences and surround the barn so that
he could not escape, and then beat in the
door and capture him&mdash;and with him the
papers. He did not know how valuable
those documents might be; but the man
now lying senseless in the inn yard had
saved them at the risk of his life; the boy
felt it his duty to do as much.</p>

<p>Colonel Knowles had now come out into
the yard and taken command of the attack.
Evidently he was recognized by the British
soldiers, despite his civilian’s dress. He
gave orders for a timber to be brought to
beat in the door, and Hadley likewise heard
him send two of the soldiers around the
barn to watch the rear. If the boy would
escape it must be within the next few
seconds.</p>

<p>He ran back to the rear of the building.
Here was another wide door and he flung
it open. The soldiers had not appeared;
but the doorsill was a good eight feet and
more from the ground. The barn had been
built on a hillside. Directly below the
door was a pen in which hogs were kept.
Eight feet was a good drop, and besides it
would be impossible to escape the soldiers
on foot.</p>

<p>A crash sounded at the front of the building.
The men had brought up the timber
for a battering ram. The door would certainly
be burst inward before many moments.
Hadley ran back to the waiting
mare that already seemed to share his
own excitement. He freed her from the
halter and sprang into the saddle. He
dared not try getting past his enemies when
the door fell and with a quick jerk of the
rein he pulled the mare around. She trotted
swiftly to the rear door which the boy had
flung open; but when she saw the distance
to the ground below, her ears went back
and she crouched.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to do it, Molly!” exclaimed
the boy, desperately. He reached to the
stanchion at his right hand and seized a
riding-whip hanging there. As the mare
continued to back, Hadley brought the lash
down again and again upon her quivering
flank. The poor beast was not used to
such treatment, and in her rage and fright
she forgot the danger ahead and leaped
straight out from the open stable door.</p>

<p>Hadley stood up in the stirrups when he
felt her go. He knew where she would
land, and he believed the feat would be
without danger; but he was ready to kick
out of the stirrups and save himself if the
little mare missed her footing.</p>

<p>Fortunately she landed just where her
rider had planned. There was a pile of
straw and barn scrapings below the door,
and from this Black Molly rebounded as
though from a mattress. She was not an
instant in recovering herself, and, still
frightened by the sting of the whip-lash,
darted out through the orchard. Hadley
flung away the whip, and, leaning forward,
hugged her neck so as not to be swept off
by the low branches of the apple trees.</p>

<p>There was a wild halloa behind him.
The dragoons sent to cut off his escape had
arrived too late; but they emptied their
pistols at the black mare and her young
rider.</p>

<p>“They won’t give up so easily,” Hadley
muttered, not daring to look around while
still in the orchard. “That Colonel
Knowles would rather die than be outwitted
by a boy. I’ll make right for the
ferry, and perhaps I may meet Holdness
somewhere on the road. I can give the
papers up to him, and I know he’ll find
some way of getting them to General
Washington.”</p>

<p>He pulled Black Molly’s head around and
took a nearer slant for the road. The mare
was more easily managed now, and when
he reached the rail fence which divided
the orchard from the highway his mount
had forgotten her fright and allowed him to
stop and fling down a part of the fence so
that they could get through and down the
bank into the road. Looking back before
descending the bank, Hadley saw several
horsemen streaming through the orchard
behind him, and, more to be feared than
these, was the party leaving the inn yard
and taking to the very road out upon which
he had come. At the head of this second
cavalcade rode Colonel Knowles himself on
his great charger, and Hadley’s heart sank.
Black Molly was famed throughout the
countryside for her speed; but that great
beast of the colonel’s&mdash;evidently brought
from across the sea, and a thoroughbred
hunter&mdash;would be more than a match for
the little mare in a long chase.</p>

<p>“We must do our best, Molly,” cried the
boy, slapping her side with his palm and
riding down into the dusty road. “You
can keep ahead of them, I know, for a short
distance, and you must do your best now.
It will soon be too dark for them to see us&mdash;that’s
a blessing.”</p>

<p>The little mare needed no spur or urging.
She clattered along the darkening road with
head down and neck outstretched, Hadley
riding with a loose rein and letting her
pick her own way over the track. He
could trust to her instinct more safely than
to his own sight. The oaks cast thick
shadows across his path, and now the whole
sky was turning a deep indigo, dotted here
and there with star points. There was
no moon until later, and he believed the
darkness was more favorable to him than
to his pursuers.</p>

<p>He could hear the thunder of the hoofs
behind him, however, and he patted Molly’s
neck encouragingly and talked to her as she
ran. “Go it, girl! you’ve got to go!” he
said. “Just make your little feet fly. Remember
the times I’ve rubbed you down,
and fed you, and taken you to water. Just
do your very prettiest, my girl, for it’s more
than my life you’ve got to save&mdash;it’s these
papers, whatever they be.”</p>

<p>And the little mare seemed to understand
what he said, for she strained every effort
for speed. She fairly skimmed over the
ground, and for the first mile or more the
hoof-beats gained not at all upon them.
Then, to Hadley’s straining ears, it seemed
as though the pursuit grew closer. It was
not a mob of hoof-beats which he heard,
but the steady, unbroken gallop of one
horse. And it took little intuition for the
boy to know which this leading pursuer
was. The great black charger, the colonel’s
mount, had left the dragoons behind, and its
stride was now shortening the distance
rapidly between its master and himself.</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly, run&mdash;run!” gasped the
boy, digging his heels into the mare’s
sides.</p>

<p>Molly was doing her best, but the sound
of the black horse’s hoofs grew louder.
The road was not straight or Hadley might
have looked back and seen the colonel
bearing down upon him. But the officer
could doubtless follow his prey by the
sound of Molly’s feet, quite as accurately as
Hadley could estimate his speed. At this
thought, and hoping to put his pursuer at
a disadvantage for the moment, the boy
pulled the mare out upon the level sward
beside the road. There Black Molly pattered
along silently: but the boy could
hear the thunder of pursuit growing louder
and louder.</p>

<p>Now that the clatter of his own mount’s
hoofs were not in his ears, Hadley was
suddenly aware of a new sound cutting the
night air. And it was not from the rear,
but from ahead&mdash;the loud complaint of
ungreased axles: a low, heavy wagon was
coming slowly along the road.</p>

<p>“If it should be Holdness!” gasped the
boy. “It sounds like his wagon.”</p>

<p>Around another turn in the crooked road
they flashed and then the creaking of the
wheels was quite near. A great covered
wagon loomed up in the dusk, and Hadley
uttered a cry of joy.</p>

<p>“Lafe! Lafe Holdness!” he shouted,
while yet the wagon was some rods away.</p>

<p>But the driver of the squeaking vehicle
heard him, and there was a flash of light
as he rose up on the footboard and held
the lantern above his head.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! slow down or ye’ll run over
me!” drawled a nasal voice.</p>

<p>“The British are after me&mdash;I’ve got dispatches!”
shouted the boy, reining in the
mare beside the wagon.</p>

<p>“Had Morris, as I’m a livin’ sinner!
What ye doin’ here?” Then the driver
cocked his head and listened to the thud
of hoofs behind the flying boy. “They’re
arter ye close, lad&mdash;an’ Molly’s winded.
Quick! there’s naught but straw in here.
It’s your best chance.”</p>

<p>The wagon was still creaking slowly
along and Holdness did not stop his team.
He dropped the lantern and dodged back to
the rear of the wagon. There he quickly
flung aside the end curtain and then returned
to the driver’s seat.</p>

<p>Hadley had ridden by, but the instant he
saw the curtain raised he wheeled Molly
about and aimed her for the end of the huge
wagon. “Quick, girl! You’ve done it before,”
muttered the boy, and the little mare
obeyed. The driver did not bring his
wagon to a stop, but it was moving very
slowly. Molly had long since learned the
trick expected of her, and she trotted up to
the rear of the vehicle, rose in the air, and
landed firmly on the straw-covered bottom.</p>

<p>“Draw the curtain, Had, ’n’ keep yer
hand on her nose,” commanded Holdness,
the teamster, without turning his head.</p>

<p>Already the boy had ordered the little
mare to lie down and she had sunk upon
the straw. He whipped down the curtain,
fastened it, and then lay down beside the
mare with his hand upon her velvety nose,
ready to stifle any desire on her part to
whinny when the pursuing horses should
arrive.</p>

<p>And they were here in a moment now.
Colonel Knowles, on his great charger,
ahead, and the company of dragoons not
many rods behind.</p>

<p class="h2sub">By OTIS T. MERRILL</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">“W</span>ELL, hurry back, boy. You’re
rather green, you know, to be
going out alone.” The captain
winked at Sergeant Mills as Tom Ray
turned towards his horse.</p>

<p>There had been no fighting as yet, and
Tom was rather disappointed, for, to tell
the truth, it was love of adventure rather
than patriotism that had induced him to
join the little squad of cavalry then journeying
through the heart of the Apache country.
They had encamped in the little valley
of the Salt River, in Arizona. The land was
dry and parched. Even the hardy cactus
was taking on a leathery hue.</p>

<p>To Tom it was a monotonous view&mdash;the
yellow earth: that everlasting Giant Cactus;
and occasionally the tall, bleached form of
a dead tree, reaching its arms despairingly
upward from the dearth of life below.</p>

<p>With some little impatience he urged
the pony into a gallop. In an hour he
must be at the fork of the Salt to receive
Custer’s dispatches. Everybody had wondered
why Tom Ray, the only one in the
party who had never heard an Indian war-whoop,
should have been chosen for the
work. It was a case of eloquence. Tom
pleaded, and the captain&mdash;who wasn’t much
afraid of Indians himself&mdash;forgot his military
caution and consented.</p>

<p>The first two miles of the journey lay
back along their own trail to the point
where a long depression in the plain
marked the bed of some old river. From
there he must turn sharp to the right and
make for the foot of the lone gray butte,
about whose base wound the west branch
of the Salt. He had started early, and it
was not yet four o’clock when he reached
the crossing of the low ground. He
paused for a moment and looked about him.</p>

<p>A large shadow rolled along the ground
before him and caught his eye. From
overhead came the shrill cry of an eagle&mdash;the
same bird who, in spite of numerous
rifle balls, had aroused the admiration of
the whole party on the previous day, by its
mad swoops in their direction.</p>

<p>Tom cast a reluctant glance at the distant
cottonwood and the huge pile of sticks
saddled in its crotch. The old egg-collecting
instinct welled up strongly within him,
but he held the mustang’s head resolutely
away. In his mind he already pictured the
impatience of the old scout at the fork and,
hardly daring to take a second look at the
nest, he again brought the little pony to a
full gallop.</p>

<p>Cris Wood had been a bearer of government
dispatches ever since the thriving
settlement of Hopkins’ Bend could boast of
a telegraph wire. His greeting for the
“youngster,” as he termed Tom Ray, was
that of an old friend:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What have you been waiting for, t’ give
the Indians a chance to scalp me?”</p>

<p>Tom laughed as he looked at the scant
fringe of gray beneath the rough, worn hat.</p>

<p>“I guess they wouldn’t be paid for their
trouble,” he answered, as he took the well-handled
dispatches from the old scout.</p>

<p>“No, not by me,” retorted the latter,
grimly. “But, anyway, there’s only one lot
of Indians around, and they’re way over at
the crossing,” referring to a point on Tom’s
return journey.</p>

<p>“All right,” responded Tom, amused at
the scout’s time-honored attempt to play
on his nerves. “If I see them, I’ll give
them the chase of their lives.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be the front party, most likely,
though.”</p>

<p>A few more courtesies were tossed freely
from one to the other, together with what
little news had fallen in the way of both
before they parted.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as the return road
before him sank gently to the lower ground,
Tom’s eyes were again drawn instinctively
to the tall cottonwood. Though still distant,
he could already see the watchful
eagle silhouetted from its topmost point.
The sun was yet high&mdash;he might as well
have a look at the nest. With this Tom
drew the horse’s head in the direction of
the great cottonwood.</p>

<p>The boy’s approach to the lofty tree was
greatly resented by the pair of golden
eagles who had chosen it as a site for their
home. A little ball of cottony down
showed itself over the side of the rude
structure. There was at least one eaglet,
and Tom knew then that it would be with
no small danger to himself if he chose to
investigate. Then there came to him the
misty recollection of the tame eagle which
Jack Warren, one of the cowboys, had
brought into camp. With this bit of memory
his hesitation vanished.</p>

<p>The tree was bare and barked. Its lower
branches had long since rotted and now lay
on the ground crumbling. Rough knots
remained, however, here and there, and by
grasping these Tom was able to make the
ascent. The old birds whirled round the
tree in giant spirals. First one and then
the other would suddenly swerve from the
circle and sweep past the boy’s head so
close that he would involuntarily throw up
his arm in defence.</p>

<p>When Tom was about thirty feet from
the ground all thought of the infuriated
birds was suddenly driven from his mind.
At a distance of perhaps one hundred yards
stood an unusually thick clump of cactus.
In the midst of this, peering intently at him,
was a dark, bronzed face&mdash;that of an
Apache Indian. A wave of terror swept
over the boy, and in his fright he imagined
he could even discern the triumphant expression
upon the swarthy visage, as it sank
behind the dark barrier.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden he became cool.
He looked for his horse. To his dismay he
discovered that the animal had wandered
some little distance from the tree. Then
he realized his danger.</p>

<p>If he descended at once it would be to
certain death. His only hope lay in
strategy.</p>

<p>Immediately he again began the struggle
upward. All the suppressed energy of the
moment went into the grip of his hands as
they took hold of the rough knots. The
eagles became more demonstrative, and
more than once the swish of a powerful
wing caused him to duck his head. But of
this he was hardly conscious. When at
length he bent over the nest, under pretense
of examining it, Tom’s eyes were in reality
strained in an attempt to locate the enemy.
He never knew whether the nest contained
one or two eaglets.</p>

<p>His mustang and the Indian were about
the same distance from the tree. But how
was he to reach the animal? A too sudden
descent would arouse suspicion. At length,
with every nerve on edge for the trial to
come, he began to work his way down.
The eagles, their courage increased with
apparent victory, gave even freer utterance
to their rage, and their shrieks as they
swooped past his head rang in the boy’s
ears for many a day afterward. On a sudden
thought, as if in mockery, he took up
the cries of the birds, imitating them by
long, piercing whistles.</p>

<p>Presently the sound varied, yet to such a
slight degree that a listener might not have
noted it. Tip, the pony, however, did seem
to notice it, and at each call would lift his
head impatiently and look in the direction
of the tree. Finally, as if by a familiar impulse,
he tossed his head in air, and walked
slowly toward the well-known call.</p>

<p>All the while Tom had kept his face in
such a direction that the Indian could not
have left his ambush without being discovered.
The pony was now within twenty
paces of the tree. By way of distracting
the Indian’s attention, the boy waved
his hat and shouted to an imaginary
comrade.</p>

<p>Then, fifteen feet from the ground, first
throwing a quick glance at his steed, Tom
allowed himself to drop. As he did so the
dreaded war-whoop rang out from the distant
clump. To his horror, an answering
call came from just ahead of him. Once
on the ground, he darted toward the horse.
A cactus plant, which on ordinary occasions
he would have given a wide berth, brushed
sharply against him, yet, in his excitement,
he hardly felt the pain it caused.</p>

<p>In the next instant he had swung into
the saddle and wheeled the pony’s head
toward the camp. The first glance ahead,
however, revealed the supple body of an
Indian half concealed by a cactus bush.
There was no choice. Striking his spurs
into the pony, Tom dashed forward. The
Indian suddenly dropped his rifle and
crouched beside a Giant Cactus. As Tom
and the mustang flew past he made a
panther-like leap, and throwing his arms
about the boy, tried to drag him from the
saddle. Turning upon him, Tom seized the
lithe arms and with all his strength tried to
throw the enemy from him. But the grip
of the savage was like that of a wild animal,
and the boy’s most vigorous efforts failed
to break it.</p>

<p>While the Indian and boy were thus
struggling, the mustang had made good
some one hundred yards, in spite of the
double burden. Though greatly excited,
Tom thought of the six-shooter at his belt,
but before he could reach it a quick movement
of the savage pinned his arms to his
side. The boy then worked his hand under
the wiry arm which held a strangling grip
on his neck. As he did so, his eyes met a
sight that changed his purpose. He
thought a moment of the savage clinging
to him. Then, with all his strength, he
wrapped his arms around the Indian and
imprisoned him. The Indian was confused
by the change of action, and, like a wild
animal, fought to release himself, for by
this time he, too, saw Sergeant Mills and
three other approaching horsemen.</p>

<p>A party of soldiers, wondering at the
boy’s delay, had ridden out from the camp,
and they were not a little surprised to see
Tom galloping toward them, carrying
what to them was a very odd looking burden.
When, upon nearer approach, this
object developed into a full-grown Apache
Indian, their astonishment knew no bounds,
and they hastened forward, lest the prisoner,
in his fierce struggles, should escape
them.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, the Indian, bound
hand and foot, was brought before the
captain, and at the same time Tom handed
over the all-important dispatches. As he
did so, the boy’s spirits reacted from their
strained condition and his sense of humor
asserted itself.</p>

<p>“Well, captain,” he said, “I knew that
you didn’t want me to be out alone, so I
brought this Indian along, just to keep me
company.”</p>

<h3>
  CHAPTER I<br />
  <small>The Storm</small>
  </h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">“M</span>ARGOT! Margot!”</p>

<p>Mother Angelique’s anxious call
rang out over the water, once,
twice, many times. But, though she shaded
her brows with her hands and strained her
keen ears to listen, there was no one visible
and no response came back to her. So
she climbed the hill again and, reëntering
the cabin, began to stir with almost vicious
energy the contents of a pot swinging in
the wide fireplace. As she toiled she muttered
and wagged her gray head, with sage
misgivings.</p>

<p>“For my soul! There is the ver’ bad
hoorican’ will come, and the child so heedless.
But the signs, the omens! This
same day I did fall asleep at the knitting
and waked a-smother. True, ’twas Meroude,
the cat, crouched on my breast; yet
what sent her, save for a warning?”</p>

<p>Though even in her scolding, the woman
smiled, recalling how Margot had jeered at
her superstition; and that when she had
dropped her bit of looking-glass the girl
had merrily congratulated her on the fact;
since by so doing, she had secured “two
mirrors in which to behold such loveliness!”</p>

<p>“No, no; not so. Death lurks in a
broken glass; or, at the best, must follow
seven full years of bad luck and sorrow.”</p>

<p>On which had come the instant reproof:</p>

<p>“Silly Angelique! When there is no
such thing as luck, but all is of the will of
God.”</p>

<p>The old nurse had frowned. The maid
was too wise for her years. She talked too
much with the master. It was not good for
women-kind to listen to grave speech or
plague their heads with graver books.
Books, indeed, were for priests and doctors;
and, maybe, now and then, for men
who could not live without them, like Master
Hugh. She, Angelique, had never read
a book in all her life. She never meant to
do so. She had not even learned a single
letter printed in their foolish pages&mdash;not
she. Yet was not she a most excellent
cook and seamstress? Was there any
cabin in all that northland as tidy as that
she ruled? Would matters have been the
better had she bothered her poor brain with
books? She knew her duty and she did it.
What more could mortal?</p>

<p>This argument had been early in the day&mdash;a
day on which the master had gone away
to the mainland and the house mistress had
improved by giving the house an extra
cleaning. To escape the soapsuds and the
loneliness, Margot had also gone, alone
and unquestioned; taking with her a luncheon
of brown bread and cold fowl, her
book and microscope. Angelique had
watched the little canoe push off from the
shore, without regret, since now she could
work unhindered at clearing the room of
the “rubbishy specimens” which the others
had brought in to mess the place.</p>

<p>Now, at supper time, perfect order
reigned, and perfect quiet, as well; save for
the purring of Meroude upon the hearth
and the simmering of the kettle. Angelique
wiped her face with her apron.</p>

<p>“The great heat, and May but young
yet. It means trouble. I wish&mdash;”</p>

<p>Suddenly the cat waked from her sleep,
and, with a sharp “meouw,” leaped to her
mistress’s shoulder; who screamed, dropped
the ladle, splashed the stew, and boxed the
animal’s ears&mdash;all within a few seconds.
Her nerves were already tingling from the
electricity in the air, and her anxiety returned
with such force that, again swinging
the crane around away from the fire, she
hurried to the beach.</p>

<p>To one so weather-wise, the unusual heat,
the leaden sky, and the intense hush were
ominous. There was not a breath of wind
stirring, apparently, yet the surface of the
lake was already dotted by tiny white-caps,
racing and chasing shoreward, like live
creatures at play. Not many times, even in
her long life in that solitude, had Angelique
Ricord seen just that curious coloring of
cloud and water, and she recalled these
with a shudder. The child she loved was
strong and skillful, but what would that
avail? Her thin face darkened, its features
sharpened, and, making a trumpet of
her hands, she put all her force into a long,
terrified halloo.</p>

<p>“Ah-ho-a-ah! Margot&mdash;Mar-g-o-t&mdash;Margot!”</p>

<p>Something clutched her shoulder, and
with another frightened scream, the woman
turned, to confront her master.</p>

<p>“Is the child away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I know not where.”</p>

<p>“Since when?”</p>

<p>“It seems but an hour, maybe two&mdash;three&mdash;and
she was here, laughing, singing,
all as ever. Though it was before the mid-day,
and she went in her canoe, still
singing.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>She pointed due east, but now into a
gloom that was impenetrable. On the instant
the lapping wavelets became breakers,
the wind rose to a deafening shriek, throwing
Angelique to the ground, and causing
even the strong man to reel before it. As
soon as he could right himself, he lifted
her in his arms and staggered up the slope.
Rather, he was almost blown up it and
through the open door into the cabin,
about which the furnishings were flying
wildly. Here the woman recovered herself
and lent her aid in closing the door
against the tempest, a task that, for a time,
seemed impossible. Her next thought was
for her dinner-pot, now swaying in the
fireplace, up which the draught was roaring
furiously. Once the precious stew was in
a sheltered corner, her courage failed again,
and she sank down beside it, moaning and
wringing her hands.</p>

<p>“It is the end of the world!”</p>

<p>“Angelique!”</p>

<p>Her wails ceased. That was a tone of
voice she had never disobeyed in all her
fifteen years of service.</p>

<p>“Yes, Master Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Spread some blankets. Brew some
herb tea. Get out a change of dry
clothing. Make everything ready against
I bring Margot in.”</p>

<p>She watched him hurrying about, securing
all the windows, piling wood on the
coals, straightening the disordered furniture,
fastening a bundle of kindlings to his
own shoulders, putting matches in the
pocket of his closely-buttoned coat, and she
caught something of his spirit. After all,
it was a relief to be doing something, even
though the roar of the tempest and the incessant
flashes of lightning turned her sick
with fear. But it was all too short a task;
and when, at last, her master climbed outward
through a sheltered rear window,
closing it behind him, her temporary
courage sank again.</p>

<p>“The broken glass! the broken glass!
Yet who would dream it is my darling’s
bright young life must pay for that and not
mine, the old and careworn? Ouch! the
blast! That bolt struck&mdash;and near! Ah,
me! Ah, me!”</p>

<p>Meroude rubbed pleadingly against her
arm, and, glad of any living companionship,
she put out her hand to touch him; but
drew it back in dread, for his sur-charged
fur sparkled and set her flesh a-tingle,
while the whole room grew luminous with
an uncanny radiance. Feeling that her
own last hour had come, poor Angelique
crouched still lower in her corner and began
to say her prayers with so much earnestness
that she became almost oblivious to
the tornado without.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, by stooping and clinging to
whatever support offered, Hugh Dutton
made his slow way beachward. But the
bushes uprooted in his clasp and the bowlders
slipped by him on this new torrent
rushing to the lake. Then he flung
himself face downward and cautiously
crawled toward the Point of Rocks
whereon he meant to make his beacon
fire.</p>

<p>“She will see it and steer by it,” he reflected;
for he would not acknowledge how
hopeless would be any human steering
under such a stress.</p>

<p>Alas! the beacon would not light. The
wind had turned icy cold and the rain
changed to hail which hurled itself upon the
tiny blaze and stifled its first breath. A
sort of desperate patience fell on the man,
and he began again, with utmost care, to
build and shelter his little stock of firewood.
Match after match he struck, and
with unvarying failure, till all were gone;
and realizing at last how chilled and rigid
he was growing, he struggled to his feet
and set them into motion.</p>

<p>Then there came a momentary lull in the
storm and he shouted aloud, as Angelique
had done:</p>

<p>“Margot! Little Margot! Margot!”</p>

<p>Another gust swept over the lake and island.
He could hear the great trees falling
in the forest, the bang, bang, bang, of
the deafening thunder, as, blinded by
lightning and overcome by exhaustion, he
sank down behind the pile of rocks and
knew no more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
  SPIRIT OR MORTAL?
  </h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE end of that great storm was almost
as sudden as its beginning.</p>

<p>Aroused by the silence that succeeded
the uproar, Angelique stood up and
rubbed her limbs, stiff with long kneeling.
The fire had gone out. Meroude was
asleep on the blankets spread for Margot,
who had not returned, nor the master. As
for that matter, the house mistress had not
expected that they ever would.</p>

<p>“There is nothin’ left. I am alone. It
was the glass. Ah! that the palsy had
seized my unlucky hand before I took it
from its shelf! How still it is. How clear,
too, is my darling’s laugh&mdash;it rings through
the room&mdash;it is a ghost. It will haunt me
always, always.”</p>

<p>Unable longer to bear the indoor silence,
which her fancy filled with familiar sounds,
she unbarred the heavy door and stepped
out.</p>

<p>“Ah! is it possible&mdash;can the sun be
setting that way&mdash;as if there had been
nothin’ happen?”</p>

<p>Wrecks strewed the open ground about
the cabin, poultry coops were washed
away, the cow-shed was a heap of ruins,
into which the trembling observer dared not
peer. That Snowfoot should be dead was
a calamity but second only to the loss of
master and nursling.</p>

<p>“Ah! my beast, my beauty. The best in
all this northern Maine. That the master
bought and brought in the big canoe for
an Easter gift to his so faithful Angelique.
And yet the sun sets as red and calm as if
all were the same as ever.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a scene of grandeur.
The storm, in passing northward, had left
scattered banks of clouds, now colored most
brilliantly by the setting sun and widely
reflected on the once more placid lake.
But neither the beauty nor the sweet, rain-washed
air, appealed to the distracted
islander, who faced the west and shook her
hand in impotent rage toward it.</p>

<p>“Shine, will you? With the harm all done
and nothin’ left but me, old Angelique.
Pouf! I turn my back on you!”</p>

<p>Then she ran shoreward with all speed,
dreading what she might find, yet eager to
know the worst, if there it might be learned.
With her apron over her head, she saw only
what lay straight before her, and so passed
the Point of Rocks without observing her
master lying behind it. But a few steps
further she paused, arrested by a sight
which turned her numb with superstitious
terror. What was that coming over the
water? A ghost! a spirit!</p>

<p>Did spirits paddle canoes and sing as this
one was singing?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The boatman’s song is borne along far over the water so blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, loud and clear, the voice we hear of the boatman so honest and true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s rowing, rowing, rowing along,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He’s rowing, rowing, rowing along&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">He’s rowing and singing his song.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The subsiding wind wafted to her ears
snatches of the jolly little ballad, in which
one could catch the very rhythm and dip of
oar or paddle. Still it was as well to wait
and see if this were flesh or apparition before
pronouncing judgment.</p>

<p>It was certainly a canoe, snowy white and
most familiar&mdash;so familiar
that the watcher
began to lose her first
terror. A girl knelt in
it, Indian-fashion, gracefully
and evenly dipping
her paddle to the melody
of her lips. Her
bare head was thrown
back and her fair hair
floated loose. Her face
was lighted by the western
glow, on which she
fixed her eyes with such
intentness that she did
not perceive the woman
who awaited her with
such mixed emotions.</p>

</div>

<p>But Tom saw. Tom,
the eagle, perched in
the bow, keen of vision
and of prejudice. Between
him and old Angelique
was a grudge of
long standing. Whenever
they met, even
after a brief separation,
he expressed his feelings
by his hoarsest
screech. He did so
now, and, by so doing,
recalled Margot from
sky-gazing and his enemy
from doubt.</p>

<p>“Ah, Angelique!
Watching for me? How
kind of you. Hush,
Tom; let her alone;
good Angelique, poor Angelique.”</p>

<p>The eagle flapped his wings with a melancholy
disdain and plunged his beak in
his breast. The old woman on the beach
was not worth minding, after all, by a
monarch of the sky&mdash;as he would be but
for his broken wing&mdash;but the girl was
worth everything, even his obedience.</p>

<p>She laughed at his sulkiness, plying her
paddle the faster, and soon reached the
pebbly beach, where she sprang out, and,
drawing her canoe out of the water, swept
her old nurse a courtesy.</p>

<p>“Home again, mother, and hungry for
my supper.”</p>

<p>“Supper, indeed! Breakin’ my heart
with your run-about ways! and the hoorican,
with ever’thin’ ruined; ever’thin’!
The master&mdash;where’s he, I know not. The
great pine broken like a match; the coops,
the cow-house, and Snowfoot&mdash;Ah, me! yet
the little one talks of supper!”</p>

<p>Margot looked about her in astonishment,
scarcely noticing the other’s words.
The devastation of her beloved home was
evident, even down on the open beach, and
she dared not think what it might be further
inland.</p>

<p>“Why, it must have been a cyclone! We
were reading about them only yesterday.
And Uncle Hugh&mdash;did you say that you
knew&mdash;where is he?”</p>

<p>Angelique shook her head.</p>

<p>“Can I tell anythin’, me? Into the
storm he went and out of it he will come
alive, as you have&mdash;if the good Lord wills,”
she added, reverently.</p>

<p>The girl sprang to the woman’s side, and
caught her arm impatiently.</p>

<p>“Tell me, quick! Where is he? where
did you last see him?”</p>

<p>“Goin’ into the hoorican, with wood
upon his shoulder. To make a beacon for
you. So I guess. But you&mdash;tell how you
come out alive of all that?”&mdash;sweeping her
arm over the outlook.</p>

<p>Margot did not stop to answer, but
darted toward the Point of Rocks, where,
if anywhere, she knew her guardian would
have tried his signal fire. In a moment she
found him.</p>

<p>“Angelique! Angelique! he’s here!
Quick, quick!&mdash;He’s&mdash;oh! is he dead? is
he dead?”</p>

<p>There was both French and Indian blood
in Mother Ricord’s veins, a passionate loyalty
in her heart, and the suppleness of
youth still in her spare frame. With a dash
she was at the girl’s side and had thrust
her away, to kneel herself and lift her
master’s head from its hard pillow of rock.</p>

<p>With swift, nervous motions she unfastened
his coat and bent her ear to his
breast.</p>

<p>“’Tis only a faint&mdash;maybe shock. In all
the world was only Margot, and Margot
he believed was lost. Ugh! the hail. See,
it is still here&mdash;look! water, and&mdash;yes, the
tea! It was for you&mdash;ah!”</p>

<p>Her words ended with a sigh of satisfaction
as a slight motion stirred the features
into which she peered so earnestly, and she
raised her master’s head a bit higher. Then
his eyes slowly opened and the dazed look
gradually gave place to a normal expression.</p>

<p>“Why, Margot! Angelique! What’s
happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Uncle Hugh! are you hurt? are
you ill? I found you here behind the rocks,
and Angelique says&mdash;but I wasn’t hurt at
all. I wasn’t out in any storm&mdash;I didn’t
know there had been one, that is, worth
minding, till I came home&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Like a ghost out of the lake. She was
not even dead&mdash;not she. And she was
singin’ fit to burst her throat while you
were&mdash;well, maybe, not dead, yourself,
but, near it.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Tom, the inquisitive,
thrust his white head forward into the
midst of the group, and, in her relief from
her first fear, Margot laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Tom! You’re one of the family,
of course, and since none of the rest of us
will die, to please that broken mirror, you
may have to! Especially, if there’s a new
brood out&mdash;”</p>

<p>But here Angelique threw up her free
hand with such a gesture of despair that
Margot said no more, and her face sobered
again, remembering that, even though they
were all still alive, there might be suffering
untold among her humbler woodland
friends. Then, as Mr. Dutton rose, almost
unaided, a fresh regret came:</p>

<p>“That there should be a cyclone right
here at home, and I not to see it! See!
look! Uncle, look! you can trace its very
path, just as we read. Away to the south
there is no sign of it, nor on the northeast.
It must have swept up to us out of the
southeast and taken our island in its track.
Oh! I wouldn’t have missed it for anything.”</p>

<p>The man rested his hand upon her shoulder
and turned her gently homeward. His
weakness had left him as it had come upon
him, with a suddenness like that of the
recent tempest. It was not the first
seizure of the kind which he had had,
though neither of these others knew it, and
the fact added a deeper gravity to his always
thoughtful manner.</p>

<p>“I am most thankful that you were not
here; but where could you have been to
escape it?”</p>

<p>“All day in the long cave. To the very
end of it, I believe, and see! I found these.
They are like the specimens you brought the
other day. They must be some rich metal.”</p>

<p>“In the long cave, you? Alone? all day?
Margot, Margot, is not the glass enough?
but you must tempt worse luck by goin’
there!” cried Angelique, who had preceded
the others on the path, but now faced about,
trembling indignantly. What foolish creature
was this who would pass a whole day
in that haunted spot, in spite of the dreadful
tales that had been told of it? “Pouf! but I
wear out my old brain everlastin’, studying
the charms that will save you from evil.
And yet&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You would do well to use some of your
charms on Tom, yonder. He’s found an
over-turned coop and looks too happy to be
out of mischief.”</p>

<p>The woman wheeled again and was off
up the slope like a flash, where presently
the king of birds was treated to the indignity
of a sound boxing, which he resented
with squawks and screeches, but not
with talons, since under each foot he held
the plump body of a fat chicken.</p>

<p>“Tom thinks a bird in the hand is worth
a score of cuffs! and Angelique’s so determined
to have somebody die&mdash;I hope it
won’t be he. A pity, though, that harm
should have happened to her own pets.
Hark! what is that?”</p>

<p>“Some poor woodland creature in distress.
The storm&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s no sound belonging to the forest.
But it is&mdash;distress!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
AN ESTRAY FROM CIVILIZATION</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEY paused by the cabin door, left
open by Angelique, and listened intently.
She, too, had caught the
alien sound, the faint, appealing halloo of
a human voice&mdash;the rarest of all cries in
that wilderness. Even the eagle’s screeches
could not drown it, but she had had enough
of anxieties for one day. Let other people
look out for themselves; her precious ones
should not stir afield again&mdash;no, not for
anything. Let the evil bird devour the
dead chickens, if he must, her place was in
the cabin, and she rushed back down the
slope, fairly forcing the others inward from
the threshold where they hesitated.</p>

<p>“’Tis a loon. You should know that, I
think, and that they’re always cryin’ fit to
scare the dead. Come! The supper’s
waitin’ this long time.”</p>

<p>With a smile that disarmed offense,
Margot caught the woman’s shoulder and
lightly swung her aside out of the way.</p>

<p>“Eat, then, hungry one! I, too, am
hungry, but&mdash;hark!”</p>

<p>The cry came again, prolonged, entreating,
not to be confounded with that of any
forest wildling.</p>

<p>“It’s from the north end of our own
island!”</p>

<p>The master’s ear was not less keen than
the girl’s, and both had the acuteness of an
Indian’s, but his judgment was better.</p>

<p>“From the mainland, across the narrows.”</p>

<p>Neither delayed, and a mutual impulse
sent them toward the shore, but again Angelique
interposed.</p>

<p>“Thoughtless child, have you no sense?
With the master just out of a faint that was
nigh death itself! With nothin’ in his poor
stomach since the mornin’, and your own as
empty. Wait; eat; then chase loons, if you
will.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dutton laughed, though he also
frowned, and cast a swift, anxious glance
toward Margot. But she was intent upon
nothing save answering that far-off cry.</p>

<p>“Which canoe, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Mine.”</p>

<p>The devoted servant made a last protest,
and caught the girl’s arm as it pushed the
light craft downward into the water.</p>

<p>“Ma petite, he is not fit. Believe me.
Better leave others to their fate than that he
should overtax himself again, so soon.”</p>

<p>Margot was astonished. In all her life
she had never before associated thought of
physical weakness with her stalwart guardian,
and a sharp fear of some unknown
trouble shot through her heart.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>The master had reached them, and now
laid his own hand upon Angelique’s detaining
one.</p>

<p>“There, woman, that’s enough. The
storm has shaken your nerves. If you’re
afraid to stay alone, Margot shall stop with
you. But let’s have no more nonsense.”</p>

<p>Mother Ricord stepped back&mdash;away.
She had done her best. Let come what
might, her conscience was clear.</p>

<p>A few seconds later the canoe pushed off
over the now darkening water, and its inmates
made all speed toward that point
from which the cry had been heard, but was
heard no more. However, the steersman
followed a perfectly direct course, and if
he were still weak from his seizure, his
movements showed no signs of it, so that
Margot’s fear for him was lost in the interest
of their present adventure. She
rhymed her own stroke to her uncle’s, and
when he rested, her paddle instantly
stopped.</p>

<p>“Halloo! hal-l-oo!” he shouted, but as
no answer came, said: “Now&mdash;both together.”</p>

<p>The girl’s shriller treble may have had
further carrying power than the man’s
voice, for there was promptly returned to
them an echoing halloo, coming apparently
from a great distance. But it was repeated
at close intervals, and each time with more
distinctness.</p>

<p>“We’ll beach the boat just yonder, under
that tamarack. Whoever it is has heard
and is coming back.”</p>

<p>Margot’s impatience broke bounds, and
she darted forward among the trees, shouting:
“This way! this way! here we are&mdash;here!”
Her peculiar life and training had
made her absolutely fearless, and she would
have been surprised by her guardian’s command
to “Wait!” had she heard it, which
she did not. Also, she knew the forest as
other girls know their city streets, and the
dimness was no hindrance to her nimble
feet. In a brief time she caught the crashing
of boughs, as some person, less familiar
than she, blundered through the underbrush
and finally came into view where a
break in the timber gave a faint light.</p>

<p>“Here! here! this way!”</p>

<p>He staggered and held out his hands, as
if for aid, and Margot clasped them firmly.
They were cold and tremulous. They were,
also, slender and smooth, not at all like the
hands of any men whom she was used to
seeing. At the relief of her touch, his
strength left him, but she caught his murmured
“Thank God! I&mdash;had&mdash;given up&mdash;”</p>

<p>His voice, too, was different from any
she knew, save her uncle’s. This was
somebody, then, from that outside world of
which she dreamed so much and knew so
little. It was like a fairy tale come true.</p>

<p>“Are you ill? There; lean on me. Don’t
fear. Oh! I’m strong, very strong, and
uncle is just yonder, coming this way.
Uncle&mdash;uncle!”</p>

<p>The stranger was almost past speech.
Mr. Dutton recognized that at once and
added his support to Margot’s. Between
them they half led, half carried the wanderer
to the canoe and lifted him into it, where
he sank exhausted. Then they dipped
their paddles and the boat shot homeward,
racing with death. Angelique was still on
the beach and still complaining of their
foolhardiness, but one word from her master
silenced that.</p>

<p>“Lend a hand, woman! Here’s something
real to worry about. Margot, go
ahead and get the lights.”</p>

<p>As the girl sprang from it, the housekeeper
pulled the boat to a spot above the
water, and, stooping, lifted a generous share
of the burden it contained.</p>

<p>It had not been a loon, then. No. Well,
she had known that from the beginning,
just as she had known that her beloved
master was in no condition to go man-hunting.
This one he had found was, probably,
dead, any way. Of course. Somebody
had to die&mdash;beyond chickens and such&mdash;had
not the broken glass so said?</p>

<p>Even in the twilight, Mr. Dutton could
detect the grim satisfaction on her face,
and smiled, foreseeing her change of expression
when this seemingly lifeless guest
should revive.</p>

<p>They laid him on the lounge that had
been spread with blankets for Margot, and
she was already beside it, waiting to administer
the herb tea which had, also, been
prepared for herself, and which she had
marveled to find so opportunely prepared.</p>

<p>Mr. Dutton smiled again. In her simplicity
the girl did not dream that the now
bitter decoction was not a common restorative
outside their primitive life, and in all
good faith forced a spoonful of it between
the closed lips.</p>

<p>“After all, it doesn’t matter. The poor
fellow is, doubtless, used to richer cordials,
but it’s hot and strong and will do the
work. You, Angelique, make us a pot of
your best coffee, and swing round that
dinner-pot. The man is almost starved,
and I’m on the road to follow him. How
about you, Margot?”</p>

<p>“I? Oh!&mdash;I guess I’m hungry&mdash;I will be&mdash;see!
He’s swallowing it&mdash;fast. Give me
that bigger spoon, Angel&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>“What would you? Scald the creature’s
throat? So he isn’t dead, after all. Well,
he needn’t have made a body think so, he
needn’t. There, Margot! you’ve messed
him with the black stuff!”</p>

<p>Indignantly brushing the child aside, the
woman seized the cup and deftly administered
its entire contents. The stranger
had not yet opened his eyes, but accepted
the warm liquid mechanically, and his nurse
hurried to fill a bowl with the broth of the
stew in the kettle. This, in turn, was taken
from her by Margot, who jealously exclaimed:</p>

<p>“He’s mine. I heard him first. I found
him first; let me be the first he sees. Dish
up the supper, please, and set my uncle’s
place.”</p>

<p>So, when a moment later, having been
nearly choked by the more substantial food
forced into his mouth, the guest opened his
eyes, they beheld the eager face of a brown-skinned,
fair-haired girl very close to his
and heard her joyous cry:</p>

<p>“He sees me! he sees everything! he’s
getting well already!”</p>

<p>He had never seen anybody like her.
Her hair was as abundant as a mantle and
rippled over her shoulders like spun gold.
So it looked in the lamplight. In fact, it
had never been bound nor covered, and
what in a different social condition might
have been much darker, had in this outdoor
life become bleached almost white. The
weather which had whitened the hair had
tanned the skin to bronze, making the blue
eyes more vivid by contrast and the red lips
redder. These were smiling now, over
well-kept teeth, and there was about the
whole bearing of the maid something suggestive
of the woodland in which she had
been reared.</p>

<p>Purity, honesty, freedom&mdash;all spoke in
every motion and tone, and, to this observer,
at least, seemed better than any
beauty. Presently, he was able to push her
too-willing hand gently away and to say:</p>

<p>“Not quite so fast, please.”</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle! hear him? He talks just as
you do! Not a bit like Pierre, or Joe, or
the rest.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dutton came forward, smiling and
remonstrating.</p>

<p>“My dear, our new friend will think you
quite rude, if you discuss him before his
face so frankly. But, sir, I assure you she
means nothing but delight at your recovery.
We are all most thankful that you are here
and safe. There, Margot; let the gentleman
rest a few minutes. Then a cup of
coffee may be better than the stew. Were
you long without food, friend?”</p>

<p>The stranger tried to answer, but the
effort tired him, and with a beckoning nod
to the young nurse, the woodlander led the
way back to the table and their own delayed
supper. Both needed it and both ate it
rather hastily, much to the disgust of Angelique,
who felt that her skill was wasted;
but one was anxious to be off out-of-doors
to learn the damage left by the storm, and
the other to be back on her stool beside the
lounge. When Mr. Dutton rose, the
housekeeper left her own seat.</p>

<p>“I’ll fetch the lantern, master. But that’s
the last of Snowfoot’s good milk you’ll ever
drink,” she sighed, touching the pitcher,
sadly.</p>

<p>“What! is anything wrong with her?”</p>

<p>“The cow-house is in ruins; so are the
poultry coops. What with falling ill yourself
just at the worst time and fetchin’ home
other sick folks, we might all go to wrack
and nobody the better.”</p>

<p>The familiar grumbling provoked only a
smile from the master, who would readily
have staked his life on the woman’s devotion
to “her people,” and knew that the
apparent crossness was not that in reality.</p>

<p>“Fie, good Angelique! You are never
so happy as when you’re miserable. Come
on; nothing must suffer if we can prevent.
Take care of our guest Margot; but give
him his nourishment slowly at intervals.
I’ll get some tools, and join you at the shed,
Angelique.”</p>

<p>He went out and the housekeeper followed
with the lantern, not needed in the
moonlight, but possibly of use at the fallen
cow-house.</p>

<p>They were long gone. The stranger
dozed, waked, ate, and dozed again. Margot,
accustomed to early hours, also slept
soundly, till a fearful shriek roused her.
Her patient was wildly kicking and striking
at some hideous monster which had settled
on his chest and would not be displaced.</p>

<p>“He’s killing me! Help&mdash;help! Oh&mdash;a&mdash;ah!”</p>

<p class="h2sub">By J. ALLISON ATWOOD</p>

<h3>THE CROW</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT does the crow say? The
syllable “caw” repeated several
times? I thought you would say
that. A tradition is hard to break; but just
listen for yourself sometime, and you will
be convinced that the crow has been sadly
misunderstood. It is “Hawk, Hawk,
Hawk,” just as plainly as one could wish.</p>

<p>Of course, you wonder why one bird
should spend all his time calling out the
name of another. Well, that’s just what I
want to tell you about.</p>

<p>It was a long time ago&mdash;before any white
people had invaded Birdland. The year had
been unusually mild and all the birds had
returned from the south where they spent
the winter. So great was the rejoicing because
of the early season that the king had
sent invitations far and wide to a spring reception.</p>

<p>Then what an excitement! For weeks
nothing was discussed but the reception
and new spring plumages.</p>

<p>When the day arrived, birds from tree-top
and meadow came by the score&mdash;waders,
climbers, perchers&mdash;in fact, all
kinds under the sun. The table, which, by
the way, very closely resembled the ground,
was festooned and hung with arbutus. Before
each guest was a relish&mdash;a dainty little
worm, served upon an equally exquisite
plate of shellbark. But why torment ourselves
with the “bill o’ fare”? Sufficient to
say that it was worthy of the occasion.</p>

<p>At the head of the table sat the king
himself, a sturdy little fellow, nicely dressed
in black and white, and wearing a concealed
crown of gold on his head. One of the
remarkable things about the king was that
he did not flaunt his royalty before his subjects.
Whenever he wore his crown he
always concealed it under a cap of feathers,
and trusted that his actions would speak
his worth.</p>

<p>Next to him sat Bob-o-link, a cheerful
little dandy, but noted, nevertheless, for a
good deal of courage and common sense.
He was the king’s right-wing bird.</p>

<p>On the other side was Brown Thrasher,
dressed in a long-tailed coat of brown and a
beautiful spotted vest. Thrasher was liked
for his wit and sauciness, but on the whole
he was a good deal of an adventurer. He
had several times claimed kinship to the
Thrushes, but they would have none of
him.</p>

<p>Among other celebrities were Mocking
Bird, a great jester and all-around wit;
Quail, the famous toastmaster, and, in fact,
all civilized birds except Night Hawk and
Whip-poor-will, who were ridiculously shy
of all public gatherings, and Crow, who had
not been invited.</p>

<p>Of course, it was a great pity that Crow
did not receive an invitation, but, somehow,
the king had taken a strong dislike to him.
The reason for this, he told his subjects, was
because Crow could not sing, but it was
really because he was black. The king
had even hesitated about inviting Blackbird
in spite of his gorgeous rainbow
lustre.</p>

<p>Well, to say the least, poor Crow’s feelings
were greatly hurt. He was very sad as he
sat high up in a nearby tree and looked
down upon the gay tumult. Crow was a
sociable fellow, and, moreover, he was very
hungry. Suddenly a thought came into
his cunning black head.</p>

<p>Just as the party was at its merriest, he
stood erect and called out in his loudest
tone, “Hawk, Hawk, Hawk!” Instantly
there was a confusion. Thrasher, quickly
gathering his coat over his new vest, scurried
into the nearest thicket. Quail, greedily
bolting the last of his dessert, so far
forgot his manners as to run straight across
the table and hide himself in the tall grass;
while Bob-o-link, checked in the midst of a
brilliant speech, vanished among the nearby
reeds. Last of all, the king, yielding to
the universal panic, took wing. In a moment
there was not a bird in sight.</p>

<p>Then Crow, laughing to himself, flew
down to the table and made short work
of the feast to which he had not been
invited. Just as he was finishing the last
mouthful, King Bird, ashamed of his hasty
flight, returned, ready to confront his
deadly enemy. Instead of the expected
Hawk, however, he found only Crow, just
then hopping up from the table and carefully
rubbing his bill against the side of a
branch.</p>

<p>Oh, what a rage he was in when he saw
the trick that had been played upon them.
With a snap of his bill, he flew at Crow like
an arrow, and would undoubtedly have injured
him had not the rascal taken instant
flight.</p>

<p>From that day to this, Crow has been an
outcast. If you watch him carefully you
will notice how warily he flies, for the
smaller birds have never ceased to torment
and abuse him.</p>

<p>King Bird in particular has never forgiven
the outrage, and whenever he hears
Crow’s mocking voice calling “Hawk,
Hawk, Hawk,” chases madly after him,
crying out, angrily, “Cheat-thief, cheat-thief.”</p>

<p>Sometimes Crow, as he thinks of the
feast, laughs exultantly as if to say, “I got
the best of you all that time.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Quail, first glancing proudly
at his own sleek form with the air of one
who has not lived in vain, mounts the top
of a nearby stump, and in his clear, shrill
voice answers, “Not quite! not&mdash;quite!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
  AN INTERRUPTED STORY
  </h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LTHOUGH it was only five o’clock,
and Manser Farm stood on a hill
so that its windows caught the last
gleam of the sun on a pleasant afternoon,
the garret was growing dark.</p>

<p>“Is it five or six days it’s been raining
without any stop?” inquired Mrs. Ramsdell,
as she dropped the lid of her horse-hair
trunk and turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>“It’s only three days come six o’clock
to-night,” said Aunty Peebles in her cheery
treble. “Don’t you recall we were just
going down to supper Monday when we
heard the first drops on the tin roof? And
this is only Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems like two weeks, that’s
all I’ve got to say about it,” grumbled Mrs.
Ramsdell, as she rose stiffly and whisked
her black alpaca skirt back and forth till
every speck of dust had flown away from
it. Most of the specks settled on Grandma
Manser who sat tranquilly knitting in her
corner by the south window.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Polly is?” suddenly
demanded Mrs. Ramsdell, bending over
the knitter and shouting fiercely in her ear.
“Why isn’t she up here this dull afternoon?
The only bright thing there is in this
house! What’s your daughter-in-law keeping
her downstairs for?”</p>

<p>“Polly?” repeated Grandma Manser,
gently. She had evidently heard only part
of the gusty speech. “Polly told me she
was planning to be out in the woodshed,
to help Uncle Sam Blodgett saw and split,
this afternoon. She said she’d be up to
recite a piece to us before supper.”</p>

<p>“H’m! I should think it was high time
she came, then,” said Mrs. Ramsdell,
crossly. But after a minute her wrinkled
face grew still more wrinkled with the smile
that broke over it as she heard a clattering
sound on the garret stairs. A second later
a rosy face about which danced a mop of
short brown curls peeped around the old
bureau which hid the stairway from the
group gathered near the windows.</p>

<p>“You’re a naughty little piece, that’s
what you are, to stay down in the woodshed
with Sam’l Blodgett, instead of coming
up here to entertain us,” cried Mrs.
Ramsdell, with twinkling eyes that contradicted
the severity of her tone. “What
have you been doing down there, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been listening to war stories,” said
Polly Prentiss, coming out from behind the
bureau. “I’ve been hearing about Uncle
Blodgett’s nephew who died down South
and ‘though but nineteen years of age displayed
great bravery on the field of battle.’
That’s on his tombstone,” said Polly, seating
herself on a little stool close to Grandma
Manser and reaching out her hand to
pat Ebenezer, the big Maltese cat.</p>

<p>“Pretty doings!” grumbled Mrs. Ramsdell,
but she smiled at Polly as she went
over to the rocking chair by Aunty Peebles.
“We old folks have been taking things out
of our trunks and putting ’em back again
just to keep up heart till you came, except
grandma there; she’s kept to her knitting,
so’s not to disturb Ebenezer of his nap, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Ebenezer’s a splendid cat, if he does
like to sleep most of the time, and looks like
Mrs. Manser’s old sack that the moths got
into,” said Polly, with a laugh. “Oh, did
any of you know there was a visitor downstairs?&mdash;that
Miss Pomeroy with the sharp
eyes. Seemed as if she’d look right
through me last Sunday, after church. I
guess she’s pleasant, though.”</p>

<p>“Folks can afford to be pleasant when
they own property and have good clothes
to their backs.” said Mrs. Ramsdell. “I
don’t know as Hetty Pomeroy’s disposition
would be any better than some other folks’
if ’twas tried in the furnace. Her father
had a high temper, I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“She’s had her trials, Miss Hetty has,”
said Aunty Peebles, gently. “She’s all
alone in the world now, excepting for Arctura
Green that’s always worked in the
family. You know she was to have had her
brother’s little girl to adopt,
and the child died of diphtheria
last fall. I understand
it was a great grief to Miss
Hetty.”</p>

<p>“What’s she here for in all
this rain?” questioned Mrs.
Ramsdell, sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s almost stopped
raining,” said
Polly stroking
Ebenezer, who
stretched out
one paw and
curved it round
her finger without
opening his
eyes. “She
drove up to the
shed to ask
Uncle Blodgett
to put her horse
in the barn.
Then I showed
her the way to
the sitting-room
and, she
said she had an
errand with
Mrs. Manser,
and I’d better
run away soon
as I’d called
her. I should
have, anyway,”
said Polly, nodding
at each of
her old friends
in turn, “for I was anxious to hurry up
here, and tell you about the things Uncle
Blodgett’s been telling me.”</p>

<p>Polly’s quick eyes had seen a half-frightened
glance exchanged between Mrs.
Ramsdell and Aunty Peebles when she
spoke of Miss Hetty’s errand, but as neither
of the old ladies seemed disposed to speak
when she paused, Polly went on, thinking
“it’s just one of their mysteries, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“First, he recited me a poem,” said Polly;
“at least, he really recited it to himself, ‘just
to keep his hand in.’ I’m not very good
about remembering poems,
but this was by Dr. Goldsmith,
Uncle Blodgett said,
and it was all about a Madam
Blaize. I asked him the name
twice, to be sure.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of either of
’em,” said Mrs. Ramsdell.
“Must both be fictitious persons.
I wonder
Samu’l Blodgett
never recites
poems to
us of an evening.
I must
say.”</p>

<p>“’Twas only
because I happened
to be
there, picking
up the chips,”
exclaimed
Polly; “and I
don’t know
whether Dr.
Goldsmith and
Madam Blaize
were fick&mdash;the
kind of persons
you said&mdash;but
she was a grand
lady in the
poem. It’s
funny, too,”
said Polly,
showing her
dimples; “in
one place it says
‘The king himself has followed her when
she has walked before.’ Of course, he’d
have to; isn’t that funny?”</p>

<p>“What else did he recite?” demanded
Mrs. Ramsdell.</p>

<p>“He didn’t recite anything else,” said
Polly, releasing her fingers from Ebenezer’s
clasp, and springing to her feet, “but he told
me a very exciting adventure he had once,
and I can act it all out for you. You see,
he was going home through some thick
woods to his log-hut. We’ll play the
bureau is the hut, and just on the edge of
the woods. If you and Aunty Peebles will
move your rocking chairs a little farther
apart you’ll make a splendid edge of the
woods,” said Polly to Mrs. Ramsdell, in a
coaxing tone, “then I can come through between.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in Dress" />
  <div class="caption"><p>I CAN ACT IT ALL OUT FOR YOU.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Anything to help out,” said the old lady,
quickly hitching her chair away from Aunty
Peebles.</p>

<p>“Now I think,” said Polly, squinting up
her eyes, “that Grandma Manser is in just
about the right place for the panther.”</p>

<p>“Mercy on us, it’s a wild beast tale,”
chuckled Mrs. Ramsdell.</p>

<p>“Grandma Manser, can you snarl like a
panther?” asked Polly, bending over the
quiet knitter, whose soft eyes had been following
the little girl’s movements. “It’s in
Uncle Blodgett’s adventure, and I’m going
to act it all out, and speak so slow and
clear, you’ll hear everything.”</p>

<p>“My yarn’s more used to snarling than I
am, dear child,” said Grandma Manser,
smiling up at the earnest face, “but I’ll do
my best. You let me know the right
minute, someway.”</p>

<p>“When I point my right arm at you with
this stick in my hand, it’s a gun that never
missed,” explained Polly to her assistants,
“that’ll be the time for you to snarl, please.”</p>

<p>Grandma Manser nodded cheerfully, and
Polly, gun in hand, ran to her position behind
Mrs. Ramsdell and Aunty Peebles.</p>

<p>“As I was walking slowly along,” said
Polly, with her lips pouted out in imitation
of Uncle Blodgett, and the gun over her
shoulder, “suddenly off to the left, not more
than a dozen rods from the house, what
should I see, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mary!” came a querulous voice from
the foot of the garret stairs. “Mary Prentiss!
Are you up there?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” answered Polly, as the gun
dropped to the floor, and Grandma Manser,
fearing she had mistaken the signal, gave a
very mild sound, meant for a fierce snarl.
“Yes’m, I’m here. Do you want me downstairs?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll mount; I’m used to trouble, and
they might as well hear the news at once,”
said the fretful voice, drawing nearer. The
stairs creaked under the slow steps; the
little company in the garret waited; disappointment
was on Polly’s face, but the old
people looked sad and anxious.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manser’s tall, thin figure and sallow,
discontented face had a depressing effect on
all of them, as she stood in her dark brown
calico, leaning against the old bureau.</p>

<p>“Mary Prentiss,” she said, solemnly,
“your chance has come, thanks to the way
I’ve brought you up and kept you clean.
Miss Hester Pomeroy, of Pomeroy Oaks, is
coming next Thursday morning to take you
home with her for a month’s trial, and if
you do your best and follow all I tell you,
there’s a likelihood Miss Pomeroy will
adopt you for good and all. And now, we
won’t have any talk or fuss over it, for I
shall need everybody’s help to get you fit to
go in time. We’re going to have supper
early to-night, so you’d better all follow me
down right off, to be on hand.”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Manser turned and creaked
slowly down the stairs, while Polly looked
from the bewildered panther to the trembling
edges of the wood with something
very like tears in her brown eyes, and
Ebenezer, after a thorough stretching of all
his paws, disappeared around the bureau
and hurried down to his evening meal.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
  GETTING READY
  </h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T seemed to Polly that no days before
ever flew so fast as the ones between
that rainy Thursday afternoon in April
and the next Thursday morning. To be
sure, Polly was not accustomed to having
new clothes especially made for her, and the
hours spent in being fitted and re-fitted
were just a waste of precious time, in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Aunty Peebles was the best dressmaker
at Manser Farm. Her fingers were old and
sometimes they trembled, but in her day
she had been a famous seamstress, and even
now she could hem a ruffle much better
than Mrs. Manser.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what the reason is my
work looks better than some,” said Aunty
Peebles, flushing with delight, one morning
when Polly had said, “Oh, what bee-yu-tiful
even, little bits of stitches you do
make!”</p>

<p>“It’s experience, that’s all it is,” said Mrs.
Manser, dejectedly, as she sat gathering the
top of a pink gingham sleeve; “if I’d been
brought up to it instead of all the education
I had that’s no good to me now, I
should be thankful, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“She’d never be thankful for anything,”
whispered Mrs. Ramsdell, who was ripping
out bastings and constantly encountering
knots which had been “machined in” and
did not soothe her temper; “’taint in her,
and you know it, Miss Peebles, well as I
do.”</p>

<p>“Mary,” said Mrs. Manser, fretfully,
“don’t sit there doing nothing. Let me see
how you’re getting on with that patchwork.
My back’s almost broken, and I’ve got
chills. You go and tell Father Manser to
bring in some wood, and then you thread
me up some needles, and fill the pincushion,
and I’ve got some basting for you
to do. What a looking square you’ve made
of that last one! Well, I don’t believe Miss
Hetty’ll keep you more than just the month,
and all this sewing and these two nice ginghams
will go for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to behave so she’ll keep me,” said
Polly, with a flushed face as she hurried out
to old Father Manser. She returned with
him after a moment. He was a thin little
man, who had a kind word for everybody,
but spoke in a husky tone, which Mrs.
Ramsdell claimed Mrs. Manser had
“frightened him into with her education
when she first married him.” However
that might be, Father Manser never made a
statement in his wife’s presence without an
appealing glance toward her for approval.</p>

<p>“Fill up the stove,” said Mrs. Manser, in
her most dismal tone, “and see if you can
take the chill off this room, father. I presume,
though, it’s in my bones and won’t
come out; I notice the others are warm
enough, for, of course, I’d have heard complaints
if they weren’t. Then you might as
well oil the machine and get ready to run
up the seams of those aprons, if your
mother ever gets them done.”</p>

<p>“I declare it riles me to see a man doing
woman’s work,” said Mrs. Ramsdell, tugging
at a vicious knot, “and doing it all
hodge-podge into the bargain!”</p>

<p>Father Manser, all unconscious of her
unfavorable criticism, filled up the stove,
and then set about oiling the sewing-machine.
By the time he had finished,
Grandma Manser had put the last careful
basting in the last apron seam, and his work
was ready for him.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t make your feet go so fast,”
cautioned Mrs. Manser, “and stop off carefully,
so you won’t break the needles the
way you did yesterday, and do keep by the
bastings, father. Are your specs on? No,
they aren’t. You put them on, this
minute!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Father Manser, meekly,
and when his spectacles were astride his
nose, he was allowed to put his feet on the
treadles and start on his first seam.</p>

<p>“He likes to run the machine,” said
Aunty Peebles to Polly. “Seems as if he
thought he’d got his foot in the stirrups
and was riding, bold and free.”</p>

<p>There were many such times for Father
Manser during this dressmaking season,
and he enjoyed them, though he knew how
much he would miss Polly when she had
gone.</p>

<p>In spite of hours spent in the house instead
of out in the sweet spring weather, in
spite of unwonted tasks, and many serious
rebukes from Mrs. Manser, the days flew
by instead of dragging slowly along as little
Polly wished they would. “Aunty”
Peebles, who had never had a real niece;
“Grandma” Manser, who had no grandchildren;
even poor Mrs. Ramsdell, with her
sharp tongue, who had “known all sorts of
trials and seen better days,”&mdash;all were
friends to Polly, the only friends she had
in the world beside Mrs. Manser, who had
brought her up, with much grumbling, to
be sure; kind Father Manser, who sometimes
gave her a stick of candy in the dark;
and Uncle Sam Blodgett, with whom she
had such exciting talks, the hero of the adventure,
the tale of which was so suddenly
interrupted.</p>

<p>Polly’s heart was sore at the thought of
leaving them all; she even felt sorry that
she must say good-bye to poor Bob Rust,
the grown man with a boy’s mind, who
could not be depended on to do the simplest
errand.</p>

<p>“He’s scatter-witted, I know,” said Polly
to herself, “but I shall miss seeing Bob, because
I’m used to him.”</p>

<p>Thursday morning came all too soon.
Miss Pomeroy was to come for Polly about
ten o’clock. At half-past nine Polly, with
anxiety written all over her rosy face, was
twirling slowly around in the middle of the
kitchen, while Mrs. Manser regarded her
forlornly from her position in the doorway,
with a hand pressed against her forehead.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll have to do as you are,”
she said at last, with a heavy sigh. “My
head aches so, I’m fit for nothing, or I’d see
what more I could do with that hair of
yours. Is that the very flattest you can
get it, Mary? I hope you’re going to remember
to answer Miss Pomeroy when she
says ‘Mary’ better than you do me, child.
It’s your rightful name, and, of course
Polly’s no kind of a name for a girl to be
adopted by. Did you say you’d done the
very best you could with your hair?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Polly, twisting her hands
together, locking and unlocking her fingers
in evident excitement. “I wet it sopping
wet, and then I patted it all down hard; but
it doesn’t stay down very well, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>Polly was right; in spots her hair was still
damp and sleek on her little head, but
around these satisfactory spots her short
curls rose and danced defiance to brush and
water.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ebenezer, I wish I had fur like
yours instead of hair!” cried Polly, but
Ebenezer only blinked at her, and retired
hastily behind the stove as if he feared she
might attempt an exchange of head-covering.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Manser, dropping into
a rocking-chair and clasping her head with
both hands, “all I’ve got to say is, you must
do the best you can by Miss Pomeroy and
all of us. You know just how much depends
on Miss Pomeroy’s adopting you.
You know what it’ll mean to Father Manser
and me and the old folks that I board for
almost nothing to keep them off the town,
if you are adopted. And Grandma&mdash;you’re
always saying you’re so fond of her&mdash;you’d
like her to have one of those new hearing
apparatuses, I should suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes’m,” said Polly, eagerly, “I do
love Grandma Manser so, and I want her to
have the ap-apyoratus. Will it cost a great
deal?”</p>

<p>“I don’t just know,” said Mrs. Manser;
“but they say Miss Pomeroy’s going to give
five hundred dollars to whatever institution
or place she finds the child she keeps, and
a present of money to the folks that have
brought her up. She didn’t mention it to
me, but the butcher told me yesterday ’twas
known all about, and she’s been sent for to
several places to see children. But she
never took a fancy to one till she saw you
in church with me. She thinks you’ve got
a look about the eyes that’s like Eleanor,
that was her brother’s little girl who died
last fall. I guess you’re about as different
from her as a child could be, every other
way.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Eleanor was an awful good,
quiet little girl, wasn’t she?” asked Polly,
timidly. “Her name sounds kind of still.
I don’t believe she ever tore her clothes,
did she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose another such good child
ever lived, according to Miss Hetty’s ideas,”
said Mrs. Manser, dismally. “She’d never
been here in town since she was a baby, and
the mother’s folks brought her and Bobby,
the twin, one summer to Pomeroy Oaks.
As I’ve told you, both parents died, leastways
they were destroyed in an accident,
when the twins were less than a year old.”</p>

<p>“And Bobby lives with his grandpa and
grandma now,” said Polly, with the air of
reciting an oft-repeated lesson, “and folks
say that saw him when he was here last
winter that he just sits and reads all the
time; he doesn’t care for play or being out-doors
much; and he never makes a speck
of dirt or a mite of noise. And when somebody
said what a good child he was, Miss
Hetty Pomeroy, she said, ‘Wait till you see
Eleanor!’ So anybody can tell what she
must have been,” concluded poor little
Polly, with a gasping breath.</p>

<p>“And so, of course,” said Mrs. Manser,
fixing a forlorn gaze on the little figure in
stiffly starched pink gingham, “if you run
wild out-doors, picking flowers and chasing
round after the live stock and wasting time
with the birds the way you’ve been allowed
to do here, you’ll lose your chance, that’s
all. You came of good folks: your
mother was my third cousin and your father
was a well-meaning man, though he wasn’t
forehanded, and always enjoyed poor
health. I’ve brought you up the best I
could for over seven years, but I expect
nothing but what Miss Hetty’ll send you
back when the month’s up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try real hard not to lose the chance,”
said Polly, earnestly. Her eyes shone with
an odd mixture of determination and fright;
there was, moreover, a decided suggestion
of tears, but Mrs. Manser, with her head in
her hands again, failed to notice it.</p>

<p>“It isn’t to be supposed you can take
Eleanor’s place,” she groaned. “You’re
willing to fetch and carry, and you’ve got a
fair disposition, but you do hate to stay
still. Your father was like that&mdash;one of
these restless folks.”</p>

<p>Polly’s face was overcast with doubt and
trouble, but she stood her ground. “I’ll
be just as like Eleanor as ever I can,” she
said, slowly. “If I could only ask Miss
Pomeroy just what Eleanor would have
done every day, I guess I could do the
same. But you’ve told me I mustn’t
speak about Eleanor, because Miss
Pomeroy doesn’t want anybody to.”
Polly looked wistfully at Mrs. Manser’s
bowed head.</p>

<p>“That makes it harder,” said Polly, when
there was no answer to this half-question,
save another groan, “but I guess I can
manage someway.” Her face looked as
nearly stern as was possible for such a combination
of soft curves and dimples, but her
eyes were misty.</p>

<p>Through the open door the soft air of the
April morning blew in to her, and her little
body thrilled with the love of the spring,
and living, growing out-door friends. But
if on her behavior depended the bestowal of
Miss Hetty’s princely sum, Manser Farm
should have it. In all the ten years of
Polly’s life she had never before heard of
such a large amount of money, except in
arithmetic examples, which, as everybody
knows, deal with all things in a bold way,
unhampered by probability.</p>

<p>With a final groan, Mrs. Manser rose and
went to the door. Then she turned quickly
to Polly.</p>

<p>“Here comes Miss Hetty now, up the
road,” she said. “Go and make your goodbyes
to the folks, child, and put on your
hat and jacket and then get your bag, so
as not to keep her waiting&mdash;she may be in
a hurry.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak sans-serif" id="A_RAMBLE">A RAMBLE IN EARLY SPRING</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">By Julia McNair Wright</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>OING out for a walk on some March
morning, we find the air soft and
warm, the skies of a summer blue,
the water rippling in every little runnel.
We look about, half expecting to see a bluebird
perched upon a fence post, a robin
stepping among the stubble. The stems
and branches which appeared dry and dead
all the winter have now a fresh exhibition of
life. We can almost see the sap creeping
up through their vessels and distributing
vigor where it goes.</p>

<p>Let us go to the woods, to some sunny
southern slope where maples grow.</p>

<p>Turning over the light, soft earth, we
shall find the maple seeds that ripened last
autumn and are now germinating. The
seeds of the maple are in pairs, which are
called keys. They look more like little tan-colored
moths than keys; the distinctly-veined,
winged husk is very like the narrow
and veined wings of many moths.</p>

<p>These seeds are winged in order that
they may be blown abroad on the wind and
plant new forests farther afield. If they
all dropped close under the shade of the
parent tree few would live beyond a year
or two.</p>

<p>Where the wing-like husks come together
there is a thickening of the base of each
into an ear-like lobe, holding a seed. The
wrapping of this seed softens, the seed enlarges
as the embryo within it grows, the
husk is pushed open, and slowly comes
forth the baby tree, composed of two leaves
and a stem. These two leaves, although
very small, are perfect and even green in
the unopened seed.</p>

<p>They are soft and fleshy; in fact, they
are pantries, full of food, ready for the weak
little plant to feed upon until it is strong
enough to forage and digest for itself.
Everyone knows that babies must be carefully
fed on delicate food until they get
their teeth. The baby plant also needs
well-prepared food.</p>

<p>Between the two leaves is a little white
stem. The two leaves unfold, and in a few
days the air and sun have made them bright
green. The stem between them thrusts a
little root into the earth; this root is furnished
with hairs. When the root is well-formed
and the two seeds have reached full
size, a bud has formed in the axil between
them.</p>

<p>This is the growing point of the new tree.
This bud presently opens into a pair of well-formed
maple leaves.</p>

<p>As these leaves increase the seed-leaves
diminish; the plant is feeding upon them.
The ascending stem presses its first pair of
leaves upward, forms between them two
more, and then two more, and thus on.</p>

<p>Small branches are formed by the end of
summer, the seed-leaves are exhausted, and
the plant is doing its own work.</p>

<p>Under the trees in March we find many
interesting examples of seed-growth. The
feeding or seed-leaves of the young plant
are called cotyledons. All flowering plants
have cotyledons; the plants whose leaves
have dividing or radiate veins, and whose
stems are woody, or, at least, not hollow,
have two cotyledons; grasses, reeds, corn,
and other grains, lilies, bamboos, all plants
with hollow stems and the leaf-veins parallel
have one cotyledon, while pines and
trees of their class have from three to twelve
cotyledons, always set in a circle.</p>

<p>The seeds, the new plants, or seedlings of
any variety are very numerous. This is
needful, as they are subject to many disasters.
They may be eaten by animals or
birds, withered by too great dry heat, devoured
by worms, frozen or ruined by overmuch
shade. If plantlets were not very
numerous the varieties of plants would
presently die out.</p>

<p>When the March winds shake out the
leaf-buds and the seeds in the ground begin
to stir with strong life, we are led to think
of the plant’s host of enemies.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the early days of our country the
guest was always honored. Friend or
stranger, the door was thrown open to
him, and the circle around the fireplace
parted willingly to receive him. After his
comfort had been assured, however, there
came inevitably to the mind of the host the
natural queries&mdash;seldom expressed in words&mdash;“What
is his name? What his purpose?”
Then the wayfarer, his reserve
thawing before the friendly greeting, would
just as naturally open his heart and speak
of himself.</p>

<p>Such was the old-time hospitality which
Hawthorne so quaintly pictures in “The
Ambitious Guest.”</p>

<p>To-day, the railroad and the comparative
luxury of travel have made the wayside
visitor a being of tradition, but the primitive
impulses of hospitality and curiosity still
survive.</p>

<p>You have opened your doors to us and
have welcomed us into that most sacred of
places&mdash;the family circle. You do not ask,
yet we cannot but feel, the old question in
your kindly gaze. You would know our
name?&mdash;our purpose?</p>

<p>Until better advised, we shall call ourselves
Young Folks Magazine.</p>

<p>Our purpose is to provide good reading
for young people. By good reading, we
mean that which is interesting enough to
catch and hold the attention of the reader,
and which, in the end, leaves him better or
wiser for having read it. But it must be
interesting, or all its other virtues fail.
The young person, particularly the boy,
looks with distrust upon the story which
comes too emphatically recommended as
useful. To him, mere utility is closely related
to dullness. With this knowledge
fresh in our memory, we promise at the
outset that our pages shall not be lacking
in a keen and healthy human interest.</p>

<p>“But,” we hear our host exclaim, “why
another magazine in a time and country
already over-run with literature?”</p>

<p>Just think a moment. Count upon your
fingers all the juvenile periodicals which
you know even by name. Compare this
supply with the demand. We are certainly
understating the figures when we say
that there are twenty million young people
in the United States. Even the most widely-circulated
of these periodicals does not
claim half a million subscribers. We believe
it safe to say that of our whole great
nation of young people, not one in ten is yet
supplied with a monthly or weekly periodical.
After all, is there not ample room for
us at the American fireside?</p>

<p>Finally, may we not ask of you a little
lenience toward our early and inevitable
shortcomings? In return, we promise you
that our own most constant aim shall be,
with each succeeding visit, better to deserve
your kindly welcome.</p>

<p>In spite of its traditional violence we
always look forward to the first month of
spring. All the more do we hail it when,
as in the present case, it brings with it the
Easter season. The name Easter is supposed
to have been derived from Oestre, the
heathen deity of Spring, in whose honor
the ancient Teutons held their annual festival.
Since the Christian era, however,
Easter has been in sole commemoration of
the Resurrection.</p>

<p>During the centuries following its inauguration
many quaint customs have sprung
up and passed away. In parts of Ireland
there is still a belief that on Easter morning
the sun dances in the sky.</p>

<p>The use of eggs for decoration and as
playthings for children at this season is of
very early origin. Nowhere is this observance
now so common as in the capital of
our own country. By immemorial custom,
on the Easter holiday, the grounds of the
White House are thrown open to the sport
of children, who come from far and near to
roll their Easter eggs across its sloping
lawns. It is a pleasant sight to see the
home of the nation’s chief executive so completely
in the hands of frolicking children.</p>

<h3>The National University</h3>

<p>Mr. Andrew Carnegie has offered the sum
of ten million dollars to the government of the
United States to endow a national institution for
the promotion of the higher scientific research.</p>

<p>While the generosity of the donor is universally
acknowledged, there are some who question
the practical value of the proposed university.</p>

<p>“Why,” they ask, “devote this vast sum to
the special education of a select few, while
thousands of our children can only with difficulty
obtain the rudiments of a common education?”</p>

<p>If the endowment in question were intended
merely for the present generation, this question
would be difficult to answer. In reality, however,
the very form and nature of the gift show
that it is dedicated not to the individual but to
the race; and it is chiefly under the leadership
of the scientific specialist that the race advances.
It is his work rather than the influence of the
common schools that has given to mankind the
steam-engine, the telegraph, and the electric
light.</p>

<p>Heretofore, however, the development of men
like Watt, Morse, Bell, and Edison has been
wholly dependent upon chance and their own
phenomenal perseverance. Who can say how
many more of such men have been lost to the
public service through mere want of opportunity?
It is this opportunity that Mr. Carnegie’s gift
would insure to coming generations.</p>

<p>As our great military school at West Point
supplies the nation with men educated for military
leadership, so this institution will create and
perpetuate a corps of savants, forever at the
service of the whole people.</p>

<p>One cannot but feel that with this gift Mr.
Carnegie has exercised an even wiser forethought
than in his many other generous benefactions.</p>

<h3>Wireless Telegraphy</h3>

<p>Signor Marconi, by means of his system of
wireless telegraphy, has at length succeeded in
transmitting the equivalent of the letter “s” from
Europe to America. A glance at the work of the
young inventor, however, will show that his success
is not yet insured.</p>

<p>His system&mdash;indeed, we might say all systems&mdash;of
wireless telegraphy depends upon the properties
of luminiferous ether&mdash;that mysterious
medium that is supposed to exist in every known
substance. The discharge of an electric spark
produces in this ether a bubble-like wave which
radiates in all directions. It is upon the reception
and recording, at Newfoundland, of this
wave, produced at England, that the success of
Marconi’s experiment depends.</p>

<p>Even to the ordinary mind, such a proposition
presents innumerable difficulties. One of the
most apparent would be the confusion arising
from two sets of signals operated in the same
locality. But just as we can throw all the rays of
a search-light in one direction, Marconi reflects
these waves of ether toward his receiving station.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the real drawbacks of this
system would be the expense of maintaining a
current of sufficient voltage to signal long distances.
Nevertheless, we feel confident that,
whether it be from the brain of Marconi or Tesla,
or the united efforts of Orling and Armstrong,
wireless telegraphy is insured to the future.</p>

<h3>The Great Tunnel</h3>

<p>We all remember with what wonder the public
viewed the construction of the great suspension
bridge between New York and Brooklyn. Remarkable
as was that feat of engineering, a far more
difficult one is now under way. It is proposed to
run a continuous tunnel under the North river,
New York City, and the East river, connecting
the Pennsylvania Railroad in New Jersey with
the Long Island Railroad at Brooklyn. It is
to be eight miles long. Its chief purpose is to
give trains, especially those from the West, a
direct and unimpeded entrance to New York
City.</p>

<p>Beginning in the neighborhood of West
Hoboken, the tunnel will penetrate the hard
ridge of the Palisades, and continue with a downward
incline until, under the North, or Hudson,
river, it will reach a depth of one hundred feet.</p>

<p>At Thirty-third street, in New York City, it
will rise to within twenty-five feet of the surface,
and at this level cross beneath Manhattan Island,
where, at some central point, a large station will
be erected. Proceeding, east, the tunnel will
again take a dip to pass the East river, and come
to light on the Brooklyn side in the neighborhood
of the present terminal of the Long Island
Railroad.</p>

<p>The work of construction will begin early in
the summer of 1902, and will require a period of
three or four years. Its estimated cost is not less
than $40,000,000.</p>

<h3>Isthmian Canal</h3>

<p>An important question which has arisen recently
is the location of the future Isthmian
canal. Shall it cross at Nicaragua or Panama?</p>

<p>The House of Representatives, on January 9th,
1902, chose the former, the best reasons being:</p>

<p>The saving of two days in the voyage between
our Atlantic and Pacific ports;</p>

<p>Its healthier climate, and the alleged lesser cost
of construction.</p>

<p>The <i>Engineering Magazine</i>, on the other hand,
sums up the advantages of the already-undertaken
Panama canal as follows:</p>

<p>It is three-fourths shorter, and could be maintained
at a cost of $1,350,000 a year less than the
Nicaragua canal, is exempt from fifty miles of
dangerous river navigation, and its completion
would require but half the amount necessary to
build the Nicaragua canal.</p>

<h3>The Danish West Indies</h3>

<p>On January 24th, 1902, the government of
Denmark, through the pen of their minister in
Washington, ceded to the United States the
group of islands known as the Danish West
Indies. Unsuccessful attempts to purchase these
islands were made in the years 1869 and 1877.</p>

<p>This last effort which, so far, promises success,
was begun two years ago. The delay has been
due to a difference of price. The amount now
agreed upon is believed to be $5,000,000.</p>

<h3>PARLOR MAGIC</h3>

<p class="h2sub">By Ellis Stanyon</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE first thing for the student of magic
to do is to learn palming, the art of
holding small objects concealed in
the hand by a slight contraction of the
palm.</p>

<p>Practice first with a half-dollar. Lay it
in the
right
hand as
shown in
Fig. 1.
Then
slightly
contract
the palm
by pressing
the ball of the thumb inward, moving
the coin about with the forefinger of the
left hand until you find it is in a favorable
position to
be gripped
by the fleshy
portions of
the hand.
Continue to
practice this
until you can
turn the
hand over without letting the coin fall.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_fig1" style="max-width: 22.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fig1.jpg" alt="Coin in Palm" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 1.&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">PALMING COIN</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When this can be accomplished with ease,
lay the coin on the tips of the second and
third fingers, steadying it with the thumb,
as in Fig. 2. Then, moving the thumb
aside to the right, bend the fingers, and
pass the coin up along the side of the
thumb into the palm, which should open to
receive it, and where, if you have followed
the instructions carefully, you will find no
difficulty in retaining it.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_fig2" style="max-width: 21.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fig2.jpg" alt="Coin betwen thumb and middle finger" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 2.&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">PALMING COIN</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Practice this movement with the right
hand in motion toward the left, as if you
really intended to place the coin in that
hand. To get the movement perfect, it is
advisable to work in front of a mirror.
Take the coin in the
right hand and actually
place it in the left several
times; then study to execute
the same movement
exactly, with the exception
that you retain the
coin in the right hand by
palming.</p>

<p>The student who desires
to become a finished
performer should palm the
various objects with equal
facility in either hand.</p>

<p>When you can hold a coin properly, as
described, practice with other objects of a
similar size. In this case, however, owing
to the greater extent of surface, it will not
be found necessary to press the object into
the palm, but simply to close the fingers
round it, in the act of apparently placing it
in the left hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pass.</span> Second only in importance
to the palming is the pass. Hold the coin
between the fingers and thumb of the left
hand (Fig. 3), and then appear to take it
in the right by passing the thumb under
and the fingers over the coin.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp38" id="i_fig3" style="max-width: 10.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fig3.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 3.&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE PASS</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Under cover of the right hand the coin is
allowed to fall into the fingers of the left,
where, by a slight contraction, it may be
held between the first and second joints, or it
may be allowed to fall into the palm proper.
The right hand must be closed and raised
as if it really contained the coin, and be
followed by the eyes of the performer; the
left falling to the side. This pass should
be performed equally well from either hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Finger Palm.</span>&mdash;Lay a coin on the
fingers as shown in Fig. 4. Then, in the
act of apparently placing it in the left hand,
raise the forefinger
slightly and clip the
coin between it and the
second finger. The left
hand must now close
as if it contained the
coin, and be followed
by the eyes of the performer,
while the right
hand disposes of the
coin as may be necessary.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 4.&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THE FINGER
PALM</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Following is an illustration
of the way
in which this sleight
can be employed with good effect.</p>

<p>Place a candle on the table to your left,
and then execute the pass as above described.
The thumb of the right hand
should now close on the edge of the coin
nearest to itself and draw it back a little;
and at the same time the candle should be
taken from the candlestick between the
thumb and fingers of the same hand.
(Fig. 5.) The left hand, which is supposed
to contain the coin, should now be
held over the candle and opened slowly, the
effect to the spectators being that the coin
is dissolved into the flame. Both hands
at this point should be shown back and
front, as the coin, owing to its peculiar
position, cannot be seen at a short distance.
You now take the upper part of the candle
in the left hand, then lower the right hand
to the lower end and produce the coin from
thence, the effect being that the money is
passing through the candle from one end
to the other.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To Change a Coin.</span>&mdash;Sometimes, in
order to bring about a desired result, it is
necessary to change, or, in conjurer’s parlance,
to “ring” a borrowed or marked coin
for a substitute of your own. There are
many ways of effecting this, but having
once mastered the various “palms” the student
will readily invent means for himself.
The following, however, is the one generally
adopted by conjurers:</p>

<p>Borrow a coin and have it marked.
Then take it between the fingers and thumb
of the left hand, as in the pass (Fig. 3),
having previously secreted the substitute in
the palm of the right. Now take the coin
in the right hand, and in so doing drop the
substitute into the palm of the left, which
you immediately close, and remark, “You
have all seen me take the coin visibly from
the left hand. I will now make it return
invisibly.” Saying this, you appear to
throw the marked coin into the left hand,
really palming it, and showing your own,
which every one takes to be the original
borrowed one. You may now proceed
with the trick in question, disposing of the
marked coin as may be necessary.</p>

<p>Let the student practice faithfully the
steps here given. He shall then be prepared
to make practical use of them, as we
shall endeavor to show in the next paper.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
